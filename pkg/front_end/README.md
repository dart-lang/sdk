# Front end for Dart

This package provides a low-level API for use by compiler back ends that wish to
implement the Dart language.  It is intended for eventual use by dev_compiler,
dart2js, and the Dart VM.  In addition, it will share implementation details
with the analyzer package--this will be accomplished by having the analyzer
package import (and re-export) parts of this package's private implementation.

End-users should use the [dartanalyzer][analyzercli] command-line tool to
analyze their Dart code.

Integrators that want to write tools that analyze Dart code should use the
[analyzer] package.

_Note:_ The APIs in this package are in an early state; developers should be
careful about depending on this package.  In particular, there is no semver
contract for release versions of this package.  Please depend directly on individual
versions.
