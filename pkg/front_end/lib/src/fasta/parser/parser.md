# Uses of peek in the parser

  * In parseType, the parser uses peekAfterIfType to tell the difference
    between `id` and `id id`.

  * In parseSwitchCase, the parser uses peekPastLabels to select between case
    labels and statement labels.

  * The parser uses isGeneralizedFunctionType in parseType, and findMemberName.

  * The parser uses findMemberName in parseTopLevelMember, and parseMember.

  * The parser uses isValidMethodTypeArguments in parseSend.
