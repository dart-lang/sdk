/**
 * @assertion Execution of a case clause case ek: sk of a switch statement
 * switch (e) {label11 ..label1j1 case e1: s1 â€¦ labeln1 ..labelnjn case en: sn default: sn+1}
 * proceeds as follows:
 * The expression ek == id  is evaluated  to an object o which is then
 * subjected to boolean conversion yielding a value v.
 * If v is not true, the following case,  case ek+1: sk+1 is executed if it exists.
 * If case ek+1: sk+1 does not exist, then the default clause is executed by executing sn+1.
 * If v is true, let h be the smallest integer such that h >= k and sh is non-empty.
 * If no such h exists, let h = n + 1. The sequence of statements sh is then executed.
 * If execution reaches the point after sh  then a runtime error occurs, unless h = n + 1.
 * @description Checks that falling through produces a runtime error, unless
 * the current clause is an empty case clause or the default clause.
