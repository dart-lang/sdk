# Each entry in this map corresponds to a diagnostic message. Ideally, each
# entry contains three parts:
#
# 1. A message template (template).
#
# 2. A suggestion for how to correct the problem (tip).
#
# 3. Examples that produce the message (one of expression, statement,
#    declaration, member, script, or bytes).
#
# A message shouldn't indicate which kind of diagnostic it is, for example,
# warning or error. Tools are expected to prepend "Warning: ", or "Error: ",
# and should be allowed to change the kind of diagnostic without affecting the
# message. For example, an error might be turned into a warning by the tool.
#
# See the file [lib/src/fasta/diagnostics.md] for more details on how to write
# good diagnostic messages.
#
# A message used for internal errors should have key that starts with
# "InternalProblem". This way, UX review can prioritize it accordingly.
#
# Eventually, we'd like to have all diagnostics in one shared
# location. However, for now, dart2js and the analyzer needs to translate error
# codes to their own format. To support this, an entry can contain an analyzer
# error code (analyzerCode) and a dart2js error code (dart2jsCode).
#
# For dart2js, there's a few special error codes:
#
# - `*ignored*` this error is ignored by dart2js (normally a recoverable parser
#   error that dart2js reports in later phase for historical reasons).
#
# - `*fatal*` this is an error that is considered fatal by dart2js (normally a
#   recoverable parser error that dart2js can't reliably recover from).
#
# dart2js only needs to translate error generated by the parser or scanner, so
# only lexical and syntactical errors have a code for dart2js. Long term, we
# assume that dart2js will rely solely on the front-end to report errors.
#
# Long term, the analyzer and front-end need to share the same error codes. So
# eventually all error codes should have an `analyzerCode` field.
#
# ## Parameter Substitution in Template and Tip
#
# The fields `template` and `tip` are subject to parameter substitution. When
# the compiler reports a problem, it may also specify a map with the following
# keys to be substituted into the message:
#
# `#character` a Unicode character.
#
# `#unicode` a Unicode short identifier (U+xxxx). We use this to represent code
#  units or code points.
#
# `#name` a name (a string).
#
# `#name2` another name (a string).
#
# `#lexeme` a token. The token's `lexeme` property is used.
#
# `#string` a string.
#
# `#string2` another string.
#
# `#uri` a Uri.

      --
        Stop option parsing, the rest of the command line is assumed to be
        file names or arguments to the Dart program.

      --packages=<file>
        Use package resolution configuration <file>, which should contain a mapping
        of package names to paths.

      --platform=<file>
        Read the SDK platform from <file>, which should be in Dill/Kernel IR format
        and contain the Dart SDK.

      --target=none|vm|vmcc|vmreify|flutter
        Specify the target configuration.

      --verify
