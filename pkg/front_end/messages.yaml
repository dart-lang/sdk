# Copyright (c) 2017, the Dart project authors.  Please see the AUTHORS file

# BSD-style license that can be found in the LICENSE file.

# Each entry in this map corresponds to a diagnostic message. Ideally, each
# entry contains three parts:
#
# 1. A message template (template).
#
# 2. A suggestion for how to correct the problem (tip).
#
# 3. Examples that produce the message (one of expression, statement,
#    declaration, member, script, bytes or external). Note that 'external'
#    should be the path to an external test. The external test will not be run,
#    but the existance of the file will be verified.
#
# A message shouldn't indicate which kind of diagnostic it is, for example,
# warning or error. Tools are expected to prepend "Warning: ", or "Error: ",
# and should be allowed to change the kind of diagnostic without affecting the
# message. For example, an error might be turned into a warning by the tool.
#
# See the file [lib/src/fasta/diagnostics.md] for more details on how to write
# good diagnostic messages.
#
# A message used for internal errors should have key that starts with
# "InternalProblem". This way, UX review can prioritize it accordingly.
#
# Eventually, we'd like to have all diagnostics in one shared
# location. However, for now, dart2js and the analyzer needs to translate error
# codes to their own format. To support this, an entry can contain an analyzer
# error code (analyzerCode) and a dart2js error code (dart2jsCode).
#
# For dart2js, there's a few special error codes:
#
# - `*ignored*` this error is ignored by dart2js (normally a recoverable parser
#   error that dart2js reports in later phase for historical reasons).
#
# - `*fatal*` this is an error that is considered fatal by dart2js (normally a
#   recoverable parser error that dart2js can't reliably recover from).
#
# dart2js only needs to translate error generated by the parser or scanner, so
# only lexical and syntactical errors have a code for dart2js. Long term, we
# assume that dart2js will rely solely on the front-end to report errors.
#
# Long term, the analyzer and front-end need to share the same error codes. So
# eventually all error codes should have an `analyzerCode` field.
#
# In some cases a mesage is internal to the frontend, and no meaningful dart2js
# nor analyzer code can be provided. In such cases set `frontendInternal: true`.
#
# ## Parameter Substitution in Template and Tip
#
# The fields `template` and `tip` are subject to parameter substitution. When
# the compiler reports a problem, it may also specify a map with the following
# keys to be substituted into the message:
#
# `#character` a Unicode character.
#
# `#unicode` a Unicode short identifier (U+xxxx). We use this to represent code
#  units or code points.
#
# `#name`, `#name2`, `#name3`: names (as strings).
#
# `#lexeme` a token. The token's `lexeme` property is used.
#
# `#string`, `#string2`, `#string3`: strings (that aren't names).
#    Note: as a rule of thumb, avoid using the `#string` keys. In particular,
#    do not use them for composing error messages, see [diagnostics.md](
#    lib/src/fasta/diagnostics.md#avoid-composing-messages-programmatically).
#
# `#type`, #type2`: Kernel types.
#
# `#uri`, `#uri2`, `#uri3`: URIs.
#
# `#count`, `#count2`: counts (as integers)
#
# `#constant` a Kernel constant.
#
# `#num1%N.M`, `#num2%N.M`, `#num3%N.M`: numbers (doubles) formatted to minimum
# width N and with M fraction digits.

FastaUsageLong:
  # TODO(ahe): Consider if the reference to platform.dill needs to change below?
  template: |
    Supported options:

      -o <file>, --output=<file>
        Generate the output into <file>.

      -h, /h, /?, --help
        Display this message (add -v for information about all options).

      -v, --verbose
        Display verbose information.

      --
        Stop option parsing, the rest of the command line is assumed to be
        file names or arguments to the Dart program.

      --packages=<file>
        Use package resolution configuration <file>, which should contain a mapping
        of package names to paths.

      --platform=<file>
        Read the SDK platform from <file>, which should be in Dill/Kernel IR format
        and contain the Dart SDK.

      --target=dart2js|dart2js_server|dart_runner|flutter|flutter_runner|none|vm
        Specify the target configuration.

      --verify
        Check that the generated output is free of various problems. This is mostly
        useful for developers of this compiler or Kernel transformations.

      --dump-ir
        Print compiled libraries in Kernel source notation.

      --bytecode
        Generate bytecode. Supported only for SDK platform compilation.

      --exclude-source
        Do not include source code in the dill file.

      --compile-sdk=<sdk>
        Compile the SDK from scratch instead of reading it from a .dill file
        (see --platform).

      --sdk=<sdk>
        Location of the SDK sources for use when compiling additional platform
        libraries.

      --fatal=errors
      --fatal=warnings
        Makes messages of the given kinds fatal, that is, immediately stop the
        compiler with a non-zero exit-code. In --verbose mode, also display an
        internal stack trace from the compiler. Multiple kinds can be separated by
        commas, for example, --fatal=errors,warnings.
