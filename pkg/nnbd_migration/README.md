# Null Safety Migration Tooling

Note: the null safety migration tooling is in an early state and may have bugs
and other issues.

For best results, use SDK version 2.9.0-10.0.dev or higher.

## How Migration Works

The migration uses a _new interactive algorithm_ designed specifically for Dart
null safety.

Typical code migration tools are designed to be run once, handle most cases, and
let the developer do manual cleanup on the result. This does **not work well**
for null safety and attempting this workflow will result in a lot more manual
work. Similarly, after your migration has been applied, the migration **cannot
be rerun** without first reverting it.

### Why does the interactive approach save so much time?

Remember that Dart already has nullable types. Every type in old Dart code is
nullable! What old Dart lacks is _non-null_ types.

And like most migrations, our tool tries to preserve your code's current
behavior. In the case of null safety, we may mark a lot of your types as
nullable -- because they really were nullable before.

Nulls are traced through your program as far as they can go, and types are
marked nullable in this process. If the tool makes a single mistake or choice
you disagree with, it can lead to many excess nullable types.

### Interactive feedback to the tool

Unintentional null is the top cause of crashes in Dart programs. By marking your
intention with comments like `/*?*/` and `/*!*/`, we can stop these
unintentional nulls from spreading through your program in your migrated code.
Adding a small number of these hints will have a huge impact on migration
quality.

The high level workflow of the tool is therefore driven through an interactive
web UI. After running `dart migrate`, open the resulting URL in a browser. Scan
through the changes, use the "nullability trace" feature to find the best place
to add a nullability hint (adding a hint in the best place can prevent dozens of
types from being made nullable). Rerun the migration and repeat, committing the
hints as you go. When the output is correct and acceptable, apply the migration
and publish your null-safe code!

For example,

```dart
List<int> ints = const [0, null];
int zero = ints[0];
int one = zero + 1;
List<int> zeroOne = [zero, one];
```

The default migration will be backwards compatible, but not ideal.

```dart
List<int?> ints = const [0, null];
int? zero = ints[0];
int one = zero! + 1;
List<int?> zeroOne = <int?>[zero, one];
```

`zero` should not be marked nullable, but it is. We then have cascading quality
issues, such as null-checking a value that shouldn't have been marked null, and
marking other variables as null due to deep null tracing. We can fix this all by
adding a single `/*!*/` hint.

```dart
List<int?> ints = const [0, null];
int/*!*/ zero = ints[0]!; // Just add /*!*/ here, the migration tool does the rest!
int one = zero + 1;
List<int> zeroOne = <int>[zero, one];
```

If you add one hint before migrating, you have done the equivalent of making
five manual edits after migrating. To find the best place to put your hints, use
the preview tool's nullability trace feature. This lets you trace back up to the
root cause of any type's inferred nullability. Add hints as close to the
original source of null as possible to have the biggest impact to the migration.

**Note**: The migration tool **cannot be rerun on a migrated codebase.** At
that point in time, every nullable and non-nullable type is indistinguishable
from an **intentionally** nullable or non-nullable type. The opportunity to
change large numbers of types for you at once without also accidentally changing
your intent has been lost. A long migration effort (such as one on a large
project) can be done incrementally, by committing these hints over time.

## Migrating a package

1. Select a package to work on, and open a command terminal in the top-level of
   the package directory.
2. Run `pub get` in order to make available all dependencies of the package.
3. Run the migration tool from the top-level of the package directory:

   ```
   dart migrate
   ```

The migration tool will display a URL for the web interface. Open that URL in a
browser to view, analyze, and improve the proposed null-safe migration.

## Using the tool

1. Run the tool (see above).
2. Once analysis and migration is complete, open the indicated URL in a browser.
3. Start with an important or interesting file in your package on the left side
   by clicking on it.
4. Look at the proposed edits in the upper right, and click on them in turn.
5. If you see an edit that looks wrong:
    1. Use the "trace view" in the bottom right to find the root cause
    2. Either click on an "add hint" button to correct it at the root, or open
       your editor and make the change manually.
        1. Some changes are as simple as adding a `/*!*/` hint on a type. The
           tool has buttons to do this for you.
        2. Others may require larger refactors. These changes can be made in
           your editor, and may often be committed and published immediately.
    3. Periodically rerun the migration and repeat.
6. Once you are satisfied with the proposed migration:
    1. Save your work using git or other means. Applying the migration will
       overwrite the existing files on disk.
       * Note: In addition to making edits to the Dart source code in
         the package, applying the migration edits the package's `pubspec.yaml`
         file, in order to change the Dart SDK version constraints, under the
         `environment` field.
    2. Rerun the migration by clicking the `Apply Migration` button in the
       interface.
    3. Tip: leaving the web UI open may help you if you later have test failures
       or analysis errors.
7. Rerun `pub get` and test your package.
    1. If a test fails, you may still use the preview to help you figure out
       what went wrong.
    2. If large changes are required, revert the migration, and go back to step
       one.
8. Commit and/or publish your migrated null-safe code.
