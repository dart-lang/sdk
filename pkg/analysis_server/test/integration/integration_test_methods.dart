  /**
   * Sets the root paths used to determine which files to analyze. The set of

   * excluded if it is in a subdirectory of one of the root paths where the

   *
   * Note that this request determines the set of requested analysis roots. The
   * actual set of analysis roots at any given time is the intersection of this
   * set with the set of files and directories actually present on the
   * filesystem. When the filesystem changes, the actual set of analysis roots
   * is automatically updated, but the set of requested analysis roots is
   * unchanged. This means that if the client sets an analysis root before the
   * root becomes visible to server in the filesystem, there is no error; once
   * the server sees the root in the filesystem it will start analyzing it.
   * Similarly, server will stop analyzing files that are removed from the file
   * system but they will remain in the set of requested roots.

   * found or the root of the file system is reached. If such a file is found,

   *
   * Parameters
   *
   * included ( List<FilePath> )
   *
   *   A list of the files and directories that should be analyzed.
   *
   * excluded ( List<FilePath> )
   *

   * packageRoots ( optional Map<FilePath, FilePath> )
   *
   *   A mapping from source directories to target directories that should
   *   override the normal package: URI resolution mechanism. The analyzer will
   *   behave as though each source directory in the map contains a special
   *   pubspec.yaml file which resolves any package: URI to the corresponding
   *   path within the target directory. The effect is the same as specifying
   *   the target directory as a "--package_root" parameter to the Dart VM when
   *   executing any Dart file inside the source directory.
   *
   *   Files in any directories that are not overridden by this mapping have
   *   their package: URI's resolved using the normal pubspec.yaml mechanism.
   *   If this field is absent, or the empty map is specified, that indicates
