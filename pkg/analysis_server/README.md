# analysis_server

A long-running process that provides analysis results to other tools.

The analysis server is designed to provide on-going analysis of one or more code
bases as those code bases are changing.

## Using the server

The analysis server is not intended to be used stand-alone, and therefore does
not have a human-friendly user interface.

Clients (typically tools, such as an editor) are expected to run the analysis
server in a separate process and communicate with it using a JSON protocol. The
original protocol is specified in the file [`analysis_server/doc/api.html`][api]
and (less complete) [Language Server Protocol][lsp_spec] support is documented
in [`tool/lsp_spec/README.md`](tool/lsp_spec/README.md).
