This directory contains sources for the "new" plugin system introduced circa
2024, which is the replacement for the "prototype" plugin system introduced
circa 2017. The sources for the "prototype" plugin system are located in
`../plugin`.

The "new" plugin system is partially based on the "prototype" plugin system. As
the "prototype" plugin system becomes deprecated and unsupported, any features
that the "new" plugin system relies on can be migrated to this directory.
