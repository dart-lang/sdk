/// An _immediate file_ is a file contained in an analysis root. This does not
/// include files that are explicitly excluded from analysis unless the excluded
/// files are referenced, directly or indirectly, from a non-excluded file.
///
/// A _transitive file_ is a file that is not an immediate file but is analyzed
/// because it is referenced, directly or indirectly, from an immediate file.
///
/// A single file can be both an immediate file in one analysis context and a
/// transitive file in one or more other analysis contexts.
///
/// The _number of lines_ in a file is just a basic line count, which includes
/// blank lines and lines containing only comments. It is not the number of
/// lines of code.
