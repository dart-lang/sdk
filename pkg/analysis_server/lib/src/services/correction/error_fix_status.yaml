# This file contains information about the status of supporting fixes for every
# diagnostic reported by the analyzer. The information supports the following
# needs.
#
# - Record which diagnostics need to be considered in order to determine whether
#   a fix for the diagnostic is possible.
#
# - Record the reasoning for saying that there is no fix for a diagnostic (when
#   that reasoning might not be obvious).
#
# - Record the fixes that could be implemented for a diagnostic, whether there
#   are existing fixes or not.
#
# The status information is recorded in a map. The key of each top-level entry
# is the unique name of an error code. The value of each top-level entry is a
# map describing the status of fixes related to that diagnostic.
#
# In every second-level map, the first key is `status` and the corresponding
# value is one of the following:
# - 'needsEvaluation', if the diagnostic has not been evaluated in terms of
#   fixes.
# - 'hasFix', if the diagnostic has one or more fixes.
# - 'noFix', if no fix seems appropriate for the diagnostic. There should be a
#   second key named `notes` whose value is text explaining why there is no
#   appropriate fix.
# - 'needsFix', if the diagnostic needs a fix. If an issue has been opened,
#   there should be a second key named `issue` whose value is the URL of the
#   issue.
#
# Note that some codes marked as 'noFix' have a note about the fix requiring a
# refactoring. In some cases we could provide a fix that adds a new declaration
# with the correct name while marking the old declaration with `deprecated`.
# That would negate the need for a refactoring while providing a step toward a
# more complete change. Doing so, however, would not be the best possible UX, so
# we might not want to do that.
#
# The other keys in the second-level map are all optional, and include
# - 'since', whose value is the version number of the SDK in which the
#   diagnostic was added.
# - 'notes', whose value is text, typically describing what fix should be
#   created or why we think a fix for the diagnostic is not appropriate.
# - 'issue', whose value is a list of the URLs of GitHub issues for the fixes
#   that should be added. Ideally every code marked as 'needsFix' would have an
#   issue created for it.
#
# Stats:
# -  62 "needsEvaluation"
# - 302 "needsFix"
# - 500 "hasFix"
# - 498 "noFix"

included_file_parse_error:
  status: noFix
  notes: |-
    The fix needs to be made in the included file.
parse_error:
  status: noFix
  notes: |-
    Because of the way the YAML parser works, there isn't enough information to
    be able to provide a fix.
analysis_option_deprecated:
  status: needsFix
  notes: |-
    The fix is to remove the deprecated option.
analysis_option_deprecated_with_replacement:
  status: hasFix
deprecated_lint:
  status: hasFix
deprecated_lint_with_replacement:
  status: needsFix
  notes: |-
    We should be able to replace the deprecated lint rule with its replacement.
duplicate_rule:
  status: hasFix
include_file_not_found:
  status: noFix
  notes: |-
    It would not be performant to search the disk for analysis options files
    that could be included.

    We could potentially have a fix to create the referenced file that currently
    doesn't exist, but that would only be useful if the missing file is in the
    same repository as the including file.
included_file_warning:
  status: noFix
  notes: |-

incompatible_lint:

  notes: |-
    Allowing the user to select which rule they would prefer to use so we can
    disable the incompatible ones.
invalid_option:
  status: needsFix
  notes: |-
    We could look for valid options that are similar in spelling to the invalid
    option and replace the invalid option with the selected replacement.
invalid_section_format:
  status: noFix
  notes: |-
    It isn't worth the cost to try to figure out how to convert
    a list, map, or string to a different format.
multiple_plugins:
  status: needsFix
  notes: |-
    The fix is to remove the plugin name. Might not be worth the cost if we
    can address the question of if/how we're supporting plugins.
plugins_in_inner_options:
  status: needsFix
  notes: |-
    The fix is to delete the 'plugins' section.
recursive_include_file:
  status: noFix
  notes: |-
    It isn't possible to know the right place to break the recursion. The best
    we could do is to remove the include in the file that the diagnostic is
    reported on.
removed_lint:

replaced_lint:

  notes: |-
    We should be able to replace the deprecated lint rule with its replacement.
undefined_lint:
  status: hasFix
unrecognized_error_code:
  status: needsFix
  notes: |-
    The fix would be to replace the code with a valid code whose name is similar
    to the unrecognized code.
unsupported_option_with_legal_value:
  status: needsFix
  notes: |-
    The fix is to replace the unsupported option with the one legal value.
unsupported_option_with_legal_values:

  notes: |-
    The fix is to replace the unsupported option with one of the legal values.

  status: hasFix
abstract_field_initializer:
  status: hasFix
abstract_super_member_reference:
  status: noFix
  notes: |-
    The only fix we could automate is to remove the call to super, which is
    unlikely to be the right solution.
ambiguous_export:
  status: needsFix
  notes: |-
    For each exported name, add a fix to hide the name.
ambiguous_extension_member_access_three_or_more:
  status: hasFix
ambiguous_extension_member_access_two:
  status: hasFix
ambiguous_import:
  status: hasFix
  notes: |-
    For each imported name, add a fix to add a prefix. We wouldn't be able to
    add the prefix everywhere, but could add it wherever the name was already
    unambiguous.
ambiguous_set_or_map_literal_both:
  status: noFix
  notes: |-
    We could potentially have a pair of fixes: one to remove the elements that
    force it to be a set and one to remove the map related elements. I doubt
    that either is the right solution.
ambiguous_set_or_map_literal_either:
  status: noFix
  notes: |-
    We don't have enough information to add type arguments for the user.
anonymous_method_wrong_parameter_list:
  status: noFix
  notes: |-
    We could remove the parameter list, or we could change it
    to `(id)` where `id` is an identifier, but we don't know
    which parameter name would be a good choice.
anonymous_method_wrong_parameter_type:
  status: noFix
  notes: |-
    We could remove the type annotation, or we could replace the
    specified type by the static type of the receiver, but having a
    type annotation is probably only relevant when the developer has
    a specific reason to _not_ use the precise type of the receiver.

assignment_to_final_no_setter:

    The fix is to create the missing setter.
assignment_to_function:
  status: noFix
  notes: |-
    Theoretically we could replace the function with a function valued variable
    if the value being assigned is a function with the same signature, but that
    case is likely rare enough to not be worth supporting.
assignment_to_method:
  status: noFix

class_used_as_mixin:

class_instantiation_access_to_static_member:

class_instantiation_access_to_unknown_member:
  status: noFix
  notes: |-
    Theoretically we could look for static members whose name is similar in
    spelling and suggest them (and remove the type arguments), but it's probably
    not valuable often enough to warrant the cost.
  since: in 2.15
concrete_class_has_enum_superinterface:
  status: noFix
  since: 2.17
  notes: |-
    We could potentially offer a fix that would remove all of the types in the
    class header that are or implement `Enum`, but I think it would be more
    likely that the user needed to restructure the super interfaces so that
    `Enum` wasn't included but the rest of the interfaces could be.
