# This file contains information about the status of supporting fixes for every
# diagnostic reported by the analyzer. The information supports the following
# needs.
#
# - Record which diagnostics need to be considered in order to determine whether
#   a fix for the diagnostic is possible.
#
# - Record the reasoning for saying that there is no fix for a diagnostic (when
#   that reasoning might not be obvious).
#
# - Record the fixes that could be implemented for a diagnostic, whether there
#   are existing fixes or not.
#
# The status information is recorded in a map. The key of each top-level entry
# is the unique name of an error code. The value of each top-level entry is a
# map describing the status of fixes related to that diagnostic.
#
# In every second-level map, the first key is `status` and the corresponding
# value is one of the following:
# - 'needsEvaluation', if the diagnostic has not been evaluated in terms of
#   fixes.
# - 'hasFix', if the diagnostic has one or more fixes.
# - 'noFix', if no fix seems appropriate for the diagnostic. There should be a
#   second key named `notes` whose value is text explaining why there is no
#   appropriate fix.
# - 'needsFix', if the diagnostic needs a fix. If an issue has been opened,
#   there should be a second key named `issue` whose value is the URL of the
#   issue.
#
# Note that some codes marked as 'noFix' have a note about the fix requiring a
# refactoring. In some cases we could provide a fix that adds a new declaration
# with the correct name while marking the old declaration with `deprecated`.
# That would negate the need for a refactoring while providing a step toward a
# more complete change. Doing so, however, would not be the best possible UX, so
# we might not want to do that.
#
# The other keys in the second-level map are all optional, and include
# - 'since', whose value is the version number of the SDK in which the
#   diagnostic was added.
# - 'notes', whose value is text, typically describing what fix should be
#   created or why we think a fix for the diagnostic is not appropriate.
# - 'issue', whose value is a list of the URLs of GitHub issues for the fixes
#   that should be added. Ideally every code marked as 'needsFix' would have an
#   issue created for it.
#
# Stats:
# -  18 "needsEvaluation"
# - 362 "needsFix"
# - 366 "hasFix"
# - 490 "noFix"

AnalysisOptionsErrorCode.INCLUDED_FILE_PARSE_ERROR:
  status: noFix
  notes: |-
    The fix needs to be made in the included file.
AnalysisOptionsErrorCode.PARSE_ERROR:
  status: noFix
  notes: |-
    Because of the way the YAML parser works, there isn't enough information to
    be able to provide a fix.
AnalysisOptionsHintCode.DEPRECATED_LINT:
  status: needsFix
  notes: |-
    We should be able to remove the lint rule.
AnalysisOptionsHintCode.DEPRECATED_LINT_WITH_REPLACEMENT:
  status: needsFix
  notes: |-
    We should be able to replace the deprecated lint rule with its replacement.
AnalysisOptionsHintCode.DUPLICATE_RULE:
  status: needsFix
  notes: |-
    We could offer to remove the duplicate rule.
AnalysisOptionsWarningCode.ANALYSIS_OPTION_DEPRECATED:
  status: needsFix
  notes: |-
    The fix is to remove the deprecated option.
AnalysisOptionsWarningCode.ANALYSIS_OPTION_DEPRECATED_WITH_REPLACEMENT:
  status: needsFix
  notes: |-
    The fix is to replace the deprecated option.
AnalysisOptionsWarningCode.INCLUDE_FILE_NOT_FOUND:
  status: noFix
  notes: |-
    It would not be performant to search the disk for analysis options files
    that could be included.

    We could potentially have a fix to create the referenced file that currently
    doesn't exist, but that would only be useful if the missing file is in the
    same repository as the including file.
AnalysisOptionsWarningCode.INCLUDED_FILE_WARNING:
  status: noFix
  notes: |-
    The fix needs to be made in the included file.
AnalysisOptionsWarningCode.INCOMPATIBLE_LINT:
  status: noFix
  notes: |-
    Without knowing which rule the user would prefer to use, we cannot remove
    the reported one.
AnalysisOptionsWarningCode.INVALID_OPTION:
  status: needsFix
  notes: |-
    We could look for valid options that are similar in spelling to the invalid
    option and replace the invalid option with the selected replacement.
AnalysisOptionsWarningCode.INVALID_SECTION_FORMAT:
  status: noFix
  notes: |-
    It isn't worth the cost to try to figure out how to convert
    a list, map, or string to a different format.
AnalysisOptionsWarningCode.MULTIPLE_PLUGINS:
  status: needsFix
  notes: |-
    The fix is to remove the plugin name. Might not be worth the cost if we
    can address the question of if/how we're supporting plugins.
AnalysisOptionsWarningCode.RECURSIVE_INCLUDE_FILE:
  status: noFix
  notes: |-
    It isn't possible to know the right place to break the recursion. The best
    we could do is to remove the include in the file that the diagnostic is
    reported on.
AnalysisOptionsWarningCode.REMOVED_LINT:
  status: needsFix
  notes: |-
    The fix is to remove the name of the removed lint rule.
AnalysisOptionsWarningCode.REPLACED_LINT:

AnalysisOptionsWarningCode.UNDEFINED_LINT:
  status: needsFix
  notes: |-
    The fix is to remove the name of the lint rule.
AnalysisOptionsWarningCode.UNRECOGNIZED_ERROR_CODE:
  status: needsFix
  notes: |-
    The fix would be to replace the code with a valid code whose name is similar
    to the unrecognized code.
AnalysisOptionsWarningCode.UNSUPPORTED_OPTION_WITH_LEGAL_VALUE:
  status: needsFix
  notes: |-
    The fix is to replace the unsupported option with the one legal value.
AnalysisOptionsWarningCode.UNSUPPORTED_OPTION_WITH_LEGAL_VALUES:
  status: needsFix
  notes: |-
    The fix is to replace the unsupported option with one of the legal values.
AnalysisOptionsWarningCode.UNSUPPORTED_OPTION_WITHOUT_VALUES:
  status: noFix
  notes: |-
    There are either no valid options to suggest, or there are too many to
    provide a fix for every one of them. For some cases it might be possible to
    suggest similarly spelled valid options, but we'd probably want to split
    this code into an `UNSUPPORTED_OPTION_WITH_SIMILAR_VALUES` code to handle
    those cases.
AnalysisOptionsWarningCode.UNSUPPORTED_VALUE:
  status: needsFix
  notes: |-
    The fix is to replace the unsupported option with one of the legal values.

CompileTimeErrorCode.AMBIGUOUS_EXPORT:

  notes: |-
    For each exported name, add a fix to hide the name.
CompileTimeErrorCode.AMBIGUOUS_EXTENSION_MEMBER_ACCESS:
  status: hasFix
CompileTimeErrorCode.AMBIGUOUS_IMPORT:
  status: needsFix
  notes: |-
    1. For each imported name, add a fix to hide the name.
    2. For each imported name, add a fix to add a prefix. We wouldn't be able to
       add the prefix everywhere, but could add it wherever the name was already
       unambiguous.
CompileTimeErrorCode.AMBIGUOUS_SET_OR_MAP_LITERAL_BOTH:
  status: noFix
  notes: |-
    We could potentially have a pair of fixes: one to remove the elements that
    force it to be a set and one to remove the map related elements. I doubt
    that either is the right solution.
CompileTimeErrorCode.AMBIGUOUS_SET_OR_MAP_LITERAL_EITHER:

CompileTimeErrorCode.ASSIGNMENT_TO_FUNCTION:
  status: noFix
  notes: |-
    Theoretically we could replace the function with a function valued variable
    if the value being assigned is a function with the same signature, but that
    case is likely rare enough to not be worth supporting.
CompileTimeErrorCode.ASSIGNMENT_TO_METHOD:
  status: noFix

CompileTimeErrorCode.BASE_CLASS_IMPLEMENTED_OUTSIDE_OF_LIBRARY:

CompileTimeErrorCode.BASE_MIXIN_IMPLEMENTED_OUTSIDE_OF_LIBRARY:

CompileTimeErrorCode.CLASS_INSTANTIATION_ACCESS_TO_UNKNOWN_MEMBER:
  status: noFix
  notes: |-
    Theoretically we could look for static members whose name is similar in

CompileTimeErrorCode.CONCRETE_CLASS_HAS_ENUM_SUPERINTERFACE:
  status: noFix
  since: 2.17
  notes: |-
    We could potentially offer a fix that would remove all of the types in the
    class header that are or implement `Enum`, but I think it would be more
    likely that the user needed to restructure the super interfaces so that
    `Enum` wasn't included but the rest of the interfaces could be.

    Theoretically, once analyzer can share dartdoc's method for finding public

LintCode.library_private_types_in_public_api:

    The fix is to either change the type in the API (which we can't automate) or

    A little tricky, but two (non-conflicting) ideas:
    1. Rename the super-parameter if it doesn't conflict with any other
       parameter name.
    2. Transpose two super parameters if doing so would match up their
       super-constructor parameters.
LintCode.missing_whitespace_between_adjacent_strings:

    The fix is to add the whitespace. Might require a preference to know which

    The fix is to either add a comma or join the strings.

LintCode.noop_primitive_operations:
  status: hasFix
LintCode.null_check_on_nullable_type_parameter:
  status: hasFix
  notes: |-
    A second fix is possible, in which we make the type parameter not
    potentially nullable, something like changing `T foo<T>()` to
    `T foo<T extends Object>()` and `T foo<T extends num?>()` to
    `T foo<T extends num>()`. This is particularly valuable in the first
    case, where the choice to implicitly bound the type to `dynamic` may not
    have been intentional.

    Theoretically we could assign the parameter to a local variable and replace

    in the next stable release.

WarningCode.MUST_CALL_SUPER:
  status: hasFix
WarningCode.NON_CONST_CALL_TO_LITERAL_CONSTRUCTOR:
  status: needsFix
  notes: |-
    The fix is to add `const` before the constructor invocation.
WarningCode.NON_CONST_CALL_TO_LITERAL_CONSTRUCTOR_USING_NEW:
  status: needsFix
  notes: |-
    The fix is to replace `new` with `const`.

WarningCode.SDK_VERSION_NEVER:
  status: noFix
  notes: Deprecated
WarningCode.SDK_VERSION_SINCE:
  status: needsFix
  notes: |-
    The fix would be to update the SDK constraints. The user would still need to
    run `dart pub` before the diagnostic would go away, and there's a question
    whether a fix that doesn't actually fix the problem is something we want.
WarningCode.STRICT_RAW_TYPE:
  status: needsFix
  notes: |-
    One fix would be to add an explicit `<dynamic>`, but we can also provide
    more helpful fixes that pretend inference works the way the user may
    have thought it did. For example in: `List a = <int>[];`, we can add
    `<int>` after `List`.
WarningCode.SUBTYPE_OF_SEALED_CLASS:
  status: needsFix
  notes: |-
    `sealed` annotation is likely to be replaced by the `sealed` keyword
    in the next stable release.
    Remove the sealed class in the `extends` or `implements` clause.
    Use RemoveNameFromDeclarationClause.

    Remove the ignore comment (or one code in the comment).
WarningCode.UNNECESSARY_CAST_PATTERN:

    The fix is to remove the cast pattern, assuming that doing so won't produce
    invalid code.
