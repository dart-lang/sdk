# This file contains information about the status of supporting fixes for every
# diagnostic reported by the analyzer. The information supports the following
# needs.
#
# - Record which diagnostics need to be considered in order to determine whether
#   a fix for the diagnostic is possible.
#
# - Record the reasoning for saying that there is no fix for a diagnostic (when
#   that reasoning might not be obvious).
#
# - Record the fixes that could be implemented for a diagnostic, whether there
#   are existing fixes or not.
#
# The status information is recorded in a map. The key of each top-level entry
# is the unique name of an error code. The value of each top-level entry is a
# map describing the status of fixes related to that diagnostic.
#
# In every second-level map, the first key is `status` and the corresponding
# value is one of the following:
# - 'needsEvaluation', if the diagnostic has not been evaluated in terms of
#   fixes.
# - 'hasFix', if the diagnostic has one or more fixes.
# - 'noFix', if no fix seems appropriate for the diagnostic. There should be a
#   second key named `notes` whose value is text explaining why there is no
#   appropriate fix.
# - 'needsFix', if the diagnostic needs a fix. If an issue has been opened,
#   there should be a second key named `issue` whose value is the URL of the
#   issue.
#
# Note that some codes marked as 'noFix' have a note about the fix requiring a
# refactoring. In some cases we could provide a fix that adds a new declaration
# with the correct name while marking the old declaration with `deprecated`.
# That would negate the need for a refactoring while providing a step toward a
# more complete change. Doing so, however, would not be the best possible UX, so
# we might not want to do that.
#
# The other keys in the second-level map are all optional, and include
# - 'since', whose value is the version number of the SDK in which the
#   diagnostic was added.
# - 'notes', whose value is text, typically describing what fix should be
#   created or why we think a fix for the diagnostic is not appropriate.
# - 'issue', whose value is a list of the URLs of GitHub issues for the fixes
#   that should be added. Ideally every code marked as 'needsFix' would have an
#   issue created for it.
#
# Stats:
# -  62 "needsEvaluation"
# - 302 "needsFix"
# - 500 "hasFix"
# - 498 "noFix"

INCLUDED_FILE_PARSE_ERROR:
  status: noFix
  notes: |-
    The fix needs to be made in the included file.
PARSE_ERROR:
  status: noFix
  notes: |-
    Because of the way the YAML parser works, there isn't enough information to
    be able to provide a fix.
ANALYSIS_OPTION_DEPRECATED:
  status: needsFix
  notes: |-
    The fix is to remove the deprecated option.
ANALYSIS_OPTION_DEPRECATED_WITH_REPLACEMENT:
  status: hasFix
DEPRECATED_LINT:
  status: hasFix
DEPRECATED_LINT_WITH_REPLACEMENT:
  status: needsFix
  notes: |-
    We should be able to replace the deprecated lint rule with its replacement.
DUPLICATE_RULE:
  status: hasFix
INCLUDE_FILE_NOT_FOUND:
  status: noFix
  notes: |-
    It would not be performant to search the disk for analysis options files
    that could be included.

    We could potentially have a fix to create the referenced file that currently
    doesn't exist, but that would only be useful if the missing file is in the
    same repository as the including file.
INCLUDED_FILE_WARNING:
  status: noFix

INCOMPATIBLE_LINT:

INVALID_OPTION:
  status: needsFix
  notes: |-
    We could look for valid options that are similar in spelling to the invalid
    option and replace the invalid option with the selected replacement.
INVALID_SECTION_FORMAT:
  status: noFix
  notes: |-
    It isn't worth the cost to try to figure out how to convert
    a list, map, or string to a different format.
MULTIPLE_PLUGINS:
  status: needsFix
  notes: |-
    The fix is to remove the plugin name. Might not be worth the cost if we
    can address the question of if/how we're supporting plugins.
PLUGINS_IN_INNER_OPTIONS:
  status: needsFix
  notes: |-
    The fix is to delete the 'plugins' section.
RECURSIVE_INCLUDE_FILE:
  status: noFix
  notes: |-
    It isn't possible to know the right place to break the recursion. The best
    we could do is to remove the include in the file that the diagnostic is
    reported on.
REMOVED_LINT:

UNDEFINED_LINT:

UNRECOGNIZED_ERROR_CODE:
  status: needsFix
  notes: |-
    The fix would be to replace the code with a valid code whose name is similar
    to the unrecognized code.
UNSUPPORTED_OPTION_WITH_LEGAL_VALUE:
  status: needsFix
  notes: |-
    The fix is to replace the unsupported option with the one legal value.
UNSUPPORTED_OPTION_WITH_LEGAL_VALUES:

    The only fix we could automate is to remove the call to super, which is

AMBIGUOUS_EXPORT:
  status: needsFix
  notes: |-
    For each exported name, add a fix to hide the name.
AMBIGUOUS_EXTENSION_MEMBER_ACCESS_THREE_OR_MORE:

AMBIGUOUS_EXTENSION_MEMBER_ACCESS_TWO:

AMBIGUOUS_IMPORT:
  status: hasFix
  notes: |-
    For each imported name, add a fix to add a prefix. We wouldn't be able to
    add the prefix everywhere, but could add it wherever the name was already
    unambiguous.
AMBIGUOUS_SET_OR_MAP_LITERAL_BOTH:
  status: noFix
  notes: |-
    We could potentially have a pair of fixes: one to remove the elements that
    force it to be a set and one to remove the map related elements. I doubt
    that either is the right solution.
AMBIGUOUS_SET_OR_MAP_LITERAL_EITHER:

ASSIGNMENT_TO_FINAL:

ASSIGNMENT_TO_FINAL_LOCAL:

ASSIGNMENT_TO_FINAL_NO_SETTER:
  status: needsFix
  notes: |-
    The fix is to create the missing setter.
ASSIGNMENT_TO_FUNCTION:
  status: noFix
  notes: |-
    Theoretically we could replace the function with a function valued variable
    if the value being assigned is a function with the same signature, but that
    case is likely rare enough to not be worth supporting.
ASSIGNMENT_TO_METHOD:
  status: noFix

CLASS_USED_AS_MIXIN:

  status: noFix
  notes: |-
    Theoretically we could look for static members whose name is similar in

    not valuable often enough to warrant the cost.
  since: in 2.15
CONCRETE_CLASS_HAS_ENUM_SUPERINTERFACE:
  status: noFix
  since: 2.17
  notes: |-
    We could potentially offer a fix that would remove all of the types in the
    class header that are or implement `Enum`, but I think it would be more
    likely that the user needed to restructure the super interfaces so that
    `Enum` wasn't included but the rest of the interfaces could be.
