    <h1>Analysis Server API Specification</h1>
    <h1 style="color:#999999">Version <version>1.16.0</version></h1>
    <p>
      This document contains a specification of the API provided by the
      analysis server.  The API in this document is currently under
      development.  Changes to the API will be accompanied by an update to the
      protocol version number according to the principles of semantic
      versioning <a href="http://semver.org/">http://semver.org/</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The analysis server API is a bi-directional client-server
      API. The API is independent of the transport mechanism used, but
      is heavily influenced by a model in which sockets or character
      streams are used to transport JSON-RPC encoded information.
    </p>
    <h3>Transport Mechanism</h3>
    <p>
      The characters passed to the server are expected to be encoded
      using UTF-8.
    </p>
    <p>
      When character streams are used as the transport, messages are
      delineated by newlines. This means, in particular, that the JSON
      encoding process must not introduce newlines within a
      message. Note however that newlines are used in this document
      for readability.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the client's responsibility to read output from the server to
      avoid its blocking.
    </p>
    <p>
      To ease interoperability with Lisp-based clients (which may not
      be able to easily distinguish between empty lists, empty maps,
      and null), client-to-server communication is allowed to replace
      any instance of “<tt>{}</tt>” or “<tt>[]</tt>” with null. The
      server will always properly represent empty lists as
      “<tt>[]</tt>” and empty maps as “<tt>{}</tt>”.
    </p>
    <h3>Communication Structure</h3>
    <p>
      Clients can make a request of the server and the server will
      provide a response for each request that it receives. While many
      of the requests that can be made by a client are informational
      in nature, we have chosen to always return a response so that
      clients can know whether the request was received and was
      correct.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no guarantee concerning the order in which responses
      will be returned, but there is a guarantee that the server will
      process requests in the order in which they are sent as long as
      the transport mechanism also makes this guarantee. Responses can
      be returned in an order that is different from the order in
      which the requests were received because some requests take
      longer to process than others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every request is required to have two fields and may have two
      additional optional fields. The first required field is the ‘id’
      field, which is only used by the server to associate a response
      with the request that generated the response. The second
      required field is the ‘method’ field, which is used to determine
      what the server is being requested to do. One optional field is
      the ‘params’ field, whose structure is dependent on the method
      being requested. The structure of this field is described with
      each request for which it is required. The other optional field
      is the 'clientRequestTime' field, which is a number indicating
      the time at which the client made the request (milliseconds
      since epoch). Providing clientRequestTime helps us track
      how responsive analysis server is to client requests
      and better address any issues that occur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every response has up to three fields. The first field is the
      ‘id’ field, which is always present and whose value is the
      identifier that was passed to the request that generated the
      response. The second field is the ‘error’ field, which is only
      present if an error was encountered while processing the
      request. The third field is the ‘result’ field, whose structure
      is dependent on the method being responded to, and is described
      with each request that will produce it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The server can also communicate to the clients by sending a
      notification. The purpose of these notifications is to provide
      information to clients as it becomes available rather than to
      require that clients poll for it. Unless explicitly stated, all
      notifications are designed to return the complete information
      available at the time the notification is sent; clients are not
      required to update previously communicated
      results. Consequently, the server can and should return partial
      results before all results are available. For example, the
      syntactic errors for a file can be returned as soon as the
      syntactic analysis is complete, and both syntactic and semantic
      errors can be returned together at a later time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each notification has two fields. The first field is the ‘event’
      field, which identifies the kind of notification. The second
      field is the ‘params’ field, whose structure is dependent on the
      kind of notification being sent. The structure of this field is
      described with each notification.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to be backward compatible, clients should ignore fields that were
      not specified in the version of the API on which they were based. Clients
      should also use the server.getVersion request to test that the version of
      the server supports an API before using it.
    </p>
    <h3>Eventual Consistency</h3>
    <p>
      TBD
    </p>
    <h3>Domains</h3>
    <p>
      For convenience, the API is divided into domains. Each domain is
      specified in a separate section below:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#domain_server">Server</a></li>
      <li><a href="#domain_analysis">Analysis</a></li>
      <li><a href="#domain_completion">Code Completion</a></li>
      <li><a href="#domain_search">Search</a></li>
      <li><a href="#domain_edit">Edit</a></li>
      <li><a href="#domain_execution">Execution</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The specifications of the API’s refer to data structures beyond
      the standard JSON primitives. These data structures are
      documented in the section titled <a href="#types">Types</a>.
    </p>

    </p>
    <h3>Command-line Arguments</h3>
    <p>
      The command-line arguments that can be passed to the server.
    </p>
    <h4>Options</h4>
    <blockquote>
    <dl>
      <dt>--no-error-notification</dt>
      <dd>
      Disable notifications about errors (see analysis.error). If this
      flag is not specified then notifications will be sent for all
      errors produced for all files in the actual analysis roots.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>--file-read-mode</dt>
      <dd>
      An enumeration of the ways files can be read from disk. Some clients
      normalize end of line characters which would make the file offset and
      range information incorrect. The default option is <tt>as-is</tt>, but
      can also be set to <tt>normalize-eol-always</tt>. The default option
      (<tt>as-is</tt>) reads files as they are on disk. The
      <tt>normalize-eol-always</tt> option does the following:
      <ul>
        <li>'\r\n' is converted to '\n';</li>
        <li>'\r' by itself is converted to '\n';</li>
        <li>this happens regardless of the OS editor is running on.</li>
      </ul>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>--no-index</dt>
      <dd>
      Disable the server from generating an index. If this flag is passed and an
      API is used that requires an index, then an error, <tt>NO_INDEX_GENERATED</tt>,
      will be thrown. The set of API calls that require an index include:
      refactoring calls, code completions and searching.
      <!-- TODO(jwren/scheglov): make sure that this of APIs that is complete. -->
      </dd>
    </dl>

          If a navigation region overlaps (but extends either before or after)
          the given region of the file it will be included in the result. This
          means that it is theoretically possible to get the same navigation
          region in response to multiple requests. Clients can avoid this by
          always choosing a region that starts at the beginning of a line and
          ends at the end of a (possibly different) line in the file.

          Sets the root paths used to determine which files to analyze. The set
          of files to be analyzed are all of the files in one of the root paths
          that are not either explicitly or implicitly excluded. A file is
          explicitly excluded if it is in one of the excluded paths. A file is
          implicitly excluded if it is in a subdirectory of one of the root
          paths where the name of the subdirectory starts with a period (that
          is, a hidden directory).
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that this request determines the set of requested
          analysis roots. The actual set of analysis roots at any
          given time is the intersection of this set with the set of
          files and directories actually present on the
          filesystem. When the filesystem changes, the actual set of
          analysis roots is automatically updated, but the set of
          requested analysis roots is unchanged. This means that if
          the client sets an analysis root before the root becomes
          visible to server in the filesystem, there is no error; once
          the server sees the root in the filesystem it will start
          analyzing it. Similarly, server will stop analyzing files
          that are removed from the file system but they will remain
          in the set of requested roots.
        </p>
        <p>
          If an included path represents a file, then server will look
          in the directory containing the file for a pubspec.yaml
          file. If none is found, then the parents of the directory
          will be searched until such a file is found or the root of
          the file system is reached. If such a file is found, it will
          be used to resolve package: URI’s within the file.

            <p>
              If a package root is a directory, then
              the analyzer will behave as though the associated
              source directory in the map contains a special
              pubspec.yaml file which resolves any package: URI to the
              corresponding path within that package root directory.  The
              effect is the same as specifying the package root directory as
              a "--package_root" parameter to the Dart VM when
              executing any Dart file inside the source directory.
            </p>
            <p>
              If a package root is a file, then the analyzer
              will behave as though that file is a ".packages" file in the
              source directory. The effect is the same as specifying the file
              as a "--packages" parameter to the Dart VM when
              executing any Dart file inside the source directory.

            <p>
              Files in any directories that are not overridden by this

              or the empty map is specified, that indicates that the
              normal pubspec.yaml mechanism should always be used.

          Set the priority files to the files in the given list. A
          priority file is a file that is given priority when

          and those for which analysis results will have the biggest
          impact on the user experience. The order of the files within
          the list is significant: the first file will be given higher
          priority than the second, the second higher priority than
          the third, and so on.

          explanation of how the actual analysis roots are
