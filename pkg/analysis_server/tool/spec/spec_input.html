<h1>Analysis Server API Specification</h1>
<h1 style="color:#999999">Version
  <version>1.32.1</version>
</h1>
<p>
  This document contains a specification of the API provided by the
  analysis server. The API in this document is currently under
  development. Changes to the API will be accompanied by an update to the
  protocol version number according to the principles of semantic
  versioning (<a href="http://semver.org/">semver.org</a>).
</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  The analysis server API is a bi-directional client-server
  API. The API is independent of the transport mechanism used, but
  is heavily influenced by a model in which sockets or character
  streams are used to transport JSON-RPC encoded information.
</p>
<h3>Transport Mechanism</h3>
<p>
  The characters passed to the server are expected to be encoded
  using UTF-8.
</p>
<p>
  When character streams are used as the transport, messages are
  delineated by newlines. This means, in particular, that the JSON
  encoding process must not introduce newlines within a
  message. Note however that newlines are used in this document
  for readability.
</p>
<p>
  It is the client's responsibility to read output from the server to
  avoid its blocking.
</p>
<p>
  To ease interoperability with Lisp-based clients (which may not
  be able to easily distinguish between empty lists, empty maps,
  and null), client-to-server communication is allowed to replace
  any instance of "<tt>{}</tt>" or "<tt>[]</tt>" with null. The
  server will always properly represent empty lists as
  "<tt>[]</tt>" and empty maps as "<tt>{}</tt>".
</p>
<h3>Communication Structure</h3>
<p>
  Clients can make a request of the server and the server will
  provide a response for each request that it receives. While many
  of the requests that can be made by a client are informational
  in nature, we have chosen to always return a response so that
  clients can know whether the request was received and was
  correct.
</p>
<p>
  There is no guarantee concerning the order in which responses
  will be returned, but there is a guarantee that the server will
  process requests in the order in which they are sent as long as
  the transport mechanism also makes this guarantee. Responses can
  be returned in an order that is different from the order in
  which the requests were received because some requests take
  longer to process than others.
</p>
<p>
  Every request is required to have two fields and may have two
  additional optional fields. The first required field is the ‘id’
  field, which is only used by the server to associate a response
  with the request that generated the response. The second
  required field is the ‘method’ field, which is used to determine
  what the server is being requested to do. One optional field is
  the ‘params’ field, whose structure is dependent on the method
  being requested. The structure of this field is described with
  each request for which it is required. The other optional field
  is the 'clientRequestTime' field, which is a number indicating
  the time at which the client made the request (milliseconds
  since epoch). Providing clientRequestTime helps us track
  how responsive analysis server is to client requests
  and better address any issues that occur.
</p>
<p>
  Every response has up to three fields. The first field is the
  ‘id’ field, which is always present and whose value is the
  identifier that was passed to the request that generated the
  response. The second field is the ‘error’ field, which is only
  present if an error was encountered while processing the
  request. The third field is the ‘result’ field, whose structure
  is dependent on the method being responded to, and is described
  with each request that will produce it.
</p>
<p>
  The server can also communicate to the clients by sending a
  notification. The purpose of these notifications is to provide
  information to clients as it becomes available rather than to
  require that clients poll for it. Unless explicitly stated, all
  notifications are designed to return the complete information
  available at the time the notification is sent; clients are not
  required to update previously communicated
  results. Consequently, the server can and should return partial
  results before all results are available. For example, the
  syntactic errors for a file can be returned as soon as the
  syntactic analysis is complete, and both syntactic and semantic
  errors can be returned together at a later time.
</p>
<p>
  Each notification has two fields. The first field is the ‘event’
  field, which identifies the kind of notification. The second
  field is the ‘params’ field, whose structure is dependent on the
  kind of notification being sent. The structure of this field is
  described with each notification.
</p>
<p>
  In order to be backward compatible, clients should ignore fields that were
  not specified in the version of the API on which they were based. Clients
  should also use the server.getVersion request to test that the version of
  the server supports an API before using it.
</p>
<h3>Eventual Consistency</h3>
<p>
  The analysis server satisfies requests under the principle of
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency">eventual
    consistency</a>.
  That is, in some cases it may return responses with the currently available
  results while it's catching up with unprocessed changes.
</p>
<h3>Enumerations</h3>
<p>
  Responses from the server may include enumerations indicating the kind of a
  specific item. The enums may be extended with new values in future versions of
  the server so clients should ensure unknown values are handled gracefully, either
  ignoring the item or treating it with some default/fallback handling.
</p>
<h3>Changelog</h3>
<h4>1.32.1</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Added <tt>CompletionSuggestionKind.PACKAGE_NAME</tt> for Pub package name completions in <tt>pubspec.yaml</tt></li>
</ul>
<h3>Domains</h3>
<p>
  For convenience, the API is divided into domains. Each domain is specified
  in a separate section below. The specifications of the API’s refer to data
  structures beyond the standard JSON primitives. These data structures are
  documented in the section titled <a href="#types">Types</a>.

    <dd>
      <p><b>Deprecated:</b> clients should no longer pass this option in</p>

      An enumeration of the ways files can be read from disk. Some clients
      normalize end of line characters which would make the file offset and
      range information incorrect. The default option is <tt>as-is</tt>, but
      can also be set to <tt>normalize-eol-always</tt>. The default option
      (<tt>as-is</tt>) reads files as they are on disk. The
      <tt>normalize-eol-always</tt> option does the following:
      <ul>
        <li>'\r\n' is converted to '\n';</li>
        <li>'\r' by itself is converted to '\n';</li>
        <li>this happens regardless of the OS editor is running on.</li>

          A mapping from source URIs to directly reachable source URIs. For
          example,
          a file "foo.dart" that imports "bar.dart" would have the corresponding
          mapping
          { "file:///foo.dart" : ["file:///bar.dart"] }. If "bar.dart" has
          further imports
          (or exports) there will be a mapping from the URI "file:///bar.dart"
          to them.
          To check if a specific URI is reachable from a given file, clients can
          check

  <request method="setAnalysisRoots">
    <p>
      Sets the root paths used to determine which files to analyze. The set
      of files to be analyzed are all of the files in one of the root paths
      that are not either explicitly or implicitly excluded. A file is
      explicitly excluded if it is in one of the excluded paths. A file is
      implicitly excluded if it is in a subdirectory of one of the root
      paths where the name of the subdirectory starts with a period (that
      is, a hidden directory).
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that this request determines the set of requested
      analysis roots. The actual set of analysis roots at any
      given time is the intersection of this set with the set of
      files and directories actually present on the
      filesystem. When the filesystem changes, the actual set of
      analysis roots is automatically updated, but the set of
      requested analysis roots is unchanged. This means that if
      the client sets an analysis root before the root becomes
      visible to server in the filesystem, there is no error; once
      the server sees the root in the filesystem it will start
      analyzing it. Similarly, server will stop analyzing files
      that are removed from the file system but they will remain
      in the set of requested roots.
    </p>
    <p>
      If an included path represents a file, then server will look
      in the directory containing the file for a pubspec.yaml
      file. If none is found, then the parents of the directory
      will be searched until such a file is found or the root of
      the file system is reached. If such a file is found, it will
      be used to resolve package: URI’s within the file.

          A mapping from source directories to package roots

          mechanism.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a package root is a file, then the analyzer
          will behave as though that file is a ".packages" file in the
          source directory. The effect is the same as specifying the file
          as a "--packages" parameter to the Dart VM when
          executing any Dart file inside the source directory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Files in any directories that are not overridden by this
          mapping have their package: URI's resolved using the
          normal pubspec.yaml mechanism. If this field is absent,
          or the empty map is specified, that indicates that the

      Set the priority files to the files in the given list. A
      priority file is a file that is given priority when
      scheduling which analysis work to do first. The list
      typically contains those files that are visible to the user
      and those for which analysis results will have the biggest
      impact on the user experience. The order of the files within
      the list is significant: the first file will be given higher
      priority than the second, the second higher priority than
      the third, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that this request determines the set of requested

  <request method="setSubscriptions">

      All previous subscriptions are replaced by the current set of

      then no files will be subscribed to the service, exactly as if the
      service had been included in the map with an explicit empty list of
      files.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that this request determines the set of requested
      subscriptions. The actual set of subscriptions at any given
      time is the intersection of this set with the set of files
      currently subject to analysis. The files currently subject
      to analysis are the set of files contained within an actual
      analysis root but not excluded, plus all of the files
      transitively reachable from those files via import, export
      and part directives. (See analysis.setAnalysisRoots for an
      explanation of how the actual analysis roots are
      determined.) When the actual analysis roots change, the
      actual set of subscriptions is automatically updated, but
      the set of requested subscriptions is unchanged.

<domain name="analytics" experimental="true">
  <p>
    The analytics domain contains APIs related to reporting analytics.
  </p>
  <p>
    This API allows clients to expose a UI option to enable and disable the
    analysis server's reporting of analytics. This value is shared with other
    tools and can change outside of this API; because of this, clients should
    use the analysis server's flag as the system of record. Clients can choose
    to send in additional analytics (see <tt>sendEvent</tt> and
    <tt>sendTiming</tt>) if they so choose. Dart command-line tools provide a
    disclaimer similar to:
    <tt>
      Dart SDK tools anonymously report feature usage statistics and basic crash
      reports to help improve Dart tools over time. See Google's privacy policy:
      https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/.
    </tt>
  </p>
  <p>
    The analysis server will send it's own analytics data (for example,
    operations performed, operating system type, SDK version). No data (from the
    analysis server or from clients) will be sent if analytics is disabled.
  </p>
  <request method="isEnabled">
    <p>Query whether analytics is enabled.</p>
    <p>
      This flag controls whether the analysis server sends any analytics data to
      the cloud. If disabled, the analysis server does not send any analytics
      data, and any data sent to it by clients (from <tt>sendEvent</tt> and
      <tt>sendTiming</tt>) will be ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
      The value of this flag can be changed by other tools outside of the
      analysis server's process. When you query the flag, you get the value of
      the flag at a given moment. Clients should not use the value returned to
      decide whether or not to send the <tt>sendEvent</tt> and
      <tt>sendTiming</tt> requests. Those requests should be used
      unconditionally and server will determine whether or not it is appropriate
      to forward the information to the cloud at the time each request is
      received.

      have complete control over this setting. In particular, there is no
      guarantee that the result returned by the <tt>isEnabled</tt> request will
      match the last value set via this request.
