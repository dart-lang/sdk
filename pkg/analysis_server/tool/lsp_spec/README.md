# Language Server Protocol

## LSP Support Status

Support for [the Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) (LSP) is **not production ready** but available as a preview to allow testing/integration work.

## Running the Server

Run the server from source to ensure you're running code that matches the status shown below. If you don't have a locally built SDK then a recent nightly should do. Pass the `--lsp` flag to start the server in LSP mode:

```
dart pkg/analysis_server/bin/server.dart --lsp
```

Note: In LSP the client makes the first request so there is no obvious confirmation that the server is working correctly until the client sends an `initialize` request. Unlike standard JSON RPC, [LSP requires that headers are sent](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification).

## Message Status

Below is a list of LSP methods and their implementation status.

- Method: The LSP method name
- Basic Impl: This method has an implementation but may assume some client capabilities
- Capabilities: Only types from the original spec or as advertised in client capabilities are returned
- Tests: Has automated tests
- Tested Client: Has been manually tested in at least one LSP client editor
