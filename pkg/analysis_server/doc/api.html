    <h1>Analysis Server API Specification</h1>
    <h1 style="color:#999999">WORKING DRAFT - Version 0.3</h1>
    <p>
      This document contains a specification of the API provided by
      the analysis server. The API in this document is currently under
      development and should be expected to change. In some cases
      those changes will be substantial.
    </p>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The analysis server API is a bi-directional client-server
      API. The API is independent of the transport mechanism used, but
      is heavily influenced by a model in which sockets or character
      streams are used to transport JSON-RPC encoded information.
    </p>
    <h3>Transport Mechanism</h3>
    <p>
      The characters passed to the server are expected to be encoded
      using UTF-8.
    </p>
    <p>
      When character streams are used as the transport, messages are
      delineated by newlines. This means, in particular, that the JSON
      encoding process must not introduce newlines within a
      message. Note however that newlines are used in this document
      for readability.
    </p>
    <p>
      To ease interoperability with Lisp-based clients (which may not
      be able to easily distinguish between empty lists, empty maps,
      and null), client-to-server communication is allowed to replace
      any instance of “<tt>{}</tt>” or “<tt>[]</tt>” with null. The
      server will always properly represent empty lists as
      “<tt>[]</tt>” and empty maps as “<tt>{}</tt>”.
    </p>
    <h3>Communication Structure</h3>
    <p>
      Clients can make a request of the server and the server will
      provide a response for each request that it receives. While many
      of the requests that can be made by a client are informational
      in nature, we have chosen to always return a response so that
      clients can know whether the request was received and was
      correct.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no guarantee concerning the order in which responses
      will be returned, but there is a guarantee that the server will
      process requests in the order in which they are sent as long as
      the transport mechanism also makes this guarantee. Responses can
      be returned in an order that is different from the order in
      which the requests were received because some requests take
      longer to process than others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every request is required to have two fields and may have an
      optional third field. The first required field is the ‘id’
      field, which is only used by the server to associate a response
      with the request that generated the response. The second
      required field is the ‘method’ field, which is used to determine
      what the server is being requested to do. The optional field is
      the ‘params’ field, whose structure is dependent on the method
      being requested. The structure of this field is described with
      each request for which it is required.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every response has up to three fields. The first field is the
      ‘id’ field, which is always present and whose value is the
      identifier that was passed to the request that generated the
      response. The second field is the ‘error’ field, which is only
      present if an error was encountered while processing the
      request. The third field is the ‘result’ field, whose structure
      is dependent on the method being responded to, and is described
      with each request that will produce it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The server can also communicate to the clients by sending a
      notification. The purpose of these notifications is to provide
      information to clients as it becomes available rather than to
      require that clients poll for it. Unless explicitly stated, all
      notifications are designed to return the complete information
      available at the time the notification is sent; clients are not
      required to update previously communicated
      results. Consequently, the server can and should return partial
      results before all results are available. For example, the
      syntactic errors for a file can be returned as soon as the
      syntactic analysis is complete, and both syntactic and semantic
      errors can be returned together at a later time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each notification has two fields. The first field is the ‘event’
      field, which identifies the kind of notification. The second
      field is the ‘params’ field, whose structure is dependent on the
      kind of notification being sent. The structure of this field is
      described with each notification.
    </p>
    <h3>Eventual Consistency</h3>
    <p>
      TBD
    </p>
    <h3>Domains</h3>
    <p>
      For convenience, the API is divided into domains. Each domain is
      specified in a separate section below:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#domain_server">Server</a></li>
      <li><a href="#domain_analysis">Analysis</a></li>
      <li><a href="#domain_completion">Code Completion</a></li>
      <li><a href="#domain_search">Search</a></li>
      <li><a href="#domain_edit">Edit</a></li>
      <li><a href="#domain_execution">Execution</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The specifications of the API’s refer to data structures beyond
      the standard JSON primitives. These data structures are
      documented in the section titled <a href="#types">Types</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Command-line Arguments</h3>
    <p>
      The command-line arguments that can be passed to the server.
    </p>
    <h4>Options</h4>
    <blockquote>
    <dl>
      <dt>--no-error-notification</dt>
      <dd>
      Disable notifications about errors (see analysis.error). If this
      flag is not specified then notifications will be sent for all
      errors produced for all files in the actual analysis roots.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    </blockquote>
    <h2 class="domain"><a name="domain_server">Domain: server</a></h2>
      <p>

          problems with specific requests (which are returned as part
          of the response) but is used for exceptions that occur while

        <p>
          Return the errors associated with the given file. If the
          errors for the given file have not yet been computed, or the
          most recently computed errors for the given file are out of
          date, then the response for this request will be delayed
          until they have been computed. If some or all of the errors
          for the file cannot be computed, then the subset of the
          errors that can be computed will be returned and the
          response will contain an error to indicate why the errors
          could not be computed. If the content of the file changes after this
          request was received but before a response could be sent, then an
          error of type <tt>CONTENT_MODIFIED</tt> will be generated.
        </p>
        <p>
          This request is intended to be used by clients that cannot
          asynchronously apply updated error information. Clients that
          <b>can</b> apply error information as it becomes available
          should use the information provided by the 'analysis.errors'
          notification.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a request is made for a file which does not exist, or
          which is not currently subject to analysis (e.g. because it
          is not associated with any analysis root specified to
          analysis.setAnalysisRoots), an error of type
          <tt>GET_ERRORS_INVALID_FILE</tt> will be generated.

              could be determined for the location. The list can
              contain multiple items if the file is being analyzed

          Return the navigation information associated with the given region of

          not yet been computed, or the most recently computed navigation
          information for the given file is out of date, then the response for
          this request will be delayed until it has been computed. If the
          content of the file changes after this request was received but before
          a response could be sent, then an error of type

        <p>
          If a navigation region overlaps (but extends either before or after)
          the given region of the file it will be included in the result. This
          means that it is theoretically possible to get the same navigation
          region in response to multiple requests. Clients can avoid this by
          always choosing a region that starts at the beginning of a line and
          ends at the end of a (possibly different) line in the file.

          Sets the root paths used to determine which files to
          analyze. The set of files to be analyzed are all of the
          files in one of the root paths that are not also in one of
          the excluded paths.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that this request determines the set of requested
          analysis roots. The actual set of analysis roots at any
          given time is the intersection of this set with the set of
          files and directories actually present on the
          filesystem. When the filesystem changes, the actual set of
          analysis roots is automatically updated, but the set of
          requested analysis roots is unchanged. This means that if
          the client sets an analysis root before the root becomes
          visible to server in the filesystem, there is no error; once
          the server sees the root in the filesystem it will start
          analyzing it. Similarly, server will stop analyzing files
          that are removed from the file system but they will remain
          in the set of requested roots.
        </p>
        <p>
          If an included path represents a file, then server will look
          in the directory containing the file for a pubspec.yaml
          file. If none is found, then the parents of the directory
          will be searched until such a file is found or the root of
          the file system is reached. If such a file is found, it will
          be used to resolve package: URI’s within the file.

            <p>
              A mapping from source directories to target directories
              that should override the normal package: URI resolution
              mechanism.  The analyzer will behave as though each
              source directory in the map contains a special
              pubspec.yaml file which resolves any package: URI to the
              corresponding path within the target directory.  The
              effect is the same as specifying the target directory as
              a "--package_root" parameter to the Dart VM when
              executing any Dart file inside the source directory.
            </p>
            <p>
              Files in any directories that are not overridden by this
              mapping have their package: URI's resolved using the
              normal pubspec.yaml mechanism.  If this field is absent,
              or the empty map is specified, that indicates that the
              normal pubspec.yaml mechanism should always be used.

        <p>
          Set the priority files to the files in the given list. A
          priority file is a file that is given priority when
          scheduling which analysis work to do first. The list
          typically contains those files that are visible to the user
          and those for which analysis results will have the biggest
          impact on the user experience. The order of the files within
          the list is significant: the first file will be given higher
          priority than the second, the second higher priority than
          the third, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that this request determines the set of requested
          priority files. The actual set of priority files is the
          intersection of the requested set of priority files with the
          set of files currently subject to analysis. (See
          analysis.setSubscriptions for a description of files that
          are subject to analysis.)
        </p>
        <p>
          If a requested priority file is a directory it is ignored,
          but remains in the set of requested priority files so that
          if it later becomes a file it can be included in the set of
          actual priority files.

        <p>
          Subscribe for services. All previous subscriptions are
          replaced by the current set of subscriptions. If a given
          service is not included as a key in the map then no files
          will be subscribed to the service, exactly as if the service
          had been included in the map with an explicit empty list of
          files.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that this request determines the set of requested
          subscriptions. The actual set of subscriptions at any given
          time is the intersection of this set with the set of files
          currently subject to analysis. The files currently subject
          to analysis are the set of files contained within an actual
          analysis root but not excluded, plus all of the files
          transitively reachable from those files via import, export
          and part directives. (See analysis.setAnalysisRoots for an
          explanation of how the actual analysis roots are
          determined.) When the actual analysis roots change, the
          actual set of subscriptions is automatically updated, but
          the set of requested subscriptions is unchanged.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a requested subscription is a directory it is ignored,
          but remains in the set of requested subscriptions so that if
          it later becomes a file it can be included in the set of
          actual subscriptions.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is an error if any of the keys in the map are not valid
          services. If there is an error, then the existing
          subscriptions will remain unchanged.
