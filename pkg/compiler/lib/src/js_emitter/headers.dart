const String HOOKS_API_USAGE = """
// The code supports the following hooks:
// dartPrint(message):
//    if this function is defined it is called instead of the Dart [print]
//    method.
//
// dartMainRunner(main, args):
//    if this function is defined, the Dart [main] method will not be invoked
//    directly. Instead, a closure that will invoke [main], and its arguments
//    [args] is passed to [dartMainRunner].
//
// dartDeferredLibraryLoader(uri, successCallback, errorCallback, loadId, loadPriority):
//    if this function is defined, it will be called when a deferred library
//    is loaded. It should load and eval the javascript of `uri`, and call
//    successCallback. If it fails to do so, it should call errorCallback with
//    an error. The loadId argument is the deferred import that resulted in
//    this uri being loaded. The loadPriority argument is the priority the
//    library should be loaded with as specified in the code via the
//    load-priority annotation (0: normal, 1: high).
// dartDeferredLibraryMultiLoader(uris, successCallback, errorCallback, loadId, loadPriority):
//    if this function is defined, it will be called when a deferred library
//    is loaded. It should load and eval the javascript of every URI in `uris`,
//    and call successCallback. If it fails to do so, it should call
//    errorCallback with an error. The loadId argument is the deferred import
//    that resulted in this uri being loaded. The loadPriority argument is the
//    priority the library should be loaded with as specified in the code via
//    the load-priority annotation (0: normal, 1: high).
//
// dartCallInstrumentation(id, qualifiedName):
//    if this function is defined, it will be called at each entry of a
//    method or constructor. Used only when compiling programs with
//    --experiment-call-instrumentation.
