/// Builds and maintains member override hierarchy for easy querying of targets
/// when refining call sites during type inference.
///
/// We introduce the idea of a [DynamicCallTarget] which can either target a
/// 'concrete' or 'virtual' member. A concrete member is one in which we know
/// the target member is being called directly. A virtual member is one in which
/// the call is to the target member or one of its overrides. Each member can
/// have 2 types in the type inference graph, to represent its concrete and
/// virtual versions. The type of a concrete member is based solely on the body
/// of the member. The type of a virtual member is a union of the types of
/// all its overrides. Abstract members only have virtual types since they do
/// not have bodies and cannot be invoked directly.
///
/// Init phase:
/// This class begins by processing all 'live' members, both abstract and not,
/// and constructing an override graph for these members. We track the direct
/// overrides of a member based on the class hierarchy. For every direct
/// override in this graph we also add edges into the type graph. One to join
/// the concrete and virtual version of a member and then one between its
/// virtual type and the virtual type of each direct override.
///
/// Example type flow:
/// ```
/// class A {
///   T foo(U arg) => ...;
/// }
///
/// class B extends A {
///   T foo(U arg) => ...;
/// }
/// ```
/// Parameter types flow to overrides:
/// A.fooConcrete#arg <- A.fooVirtual#arg -> B.fooVirtual#arg
///
/// Return types flow from overrides:
/// A.fooConcrete#Return -> A.fooVirtual#Return <- B.fooVirtual#Return
///
/// We also maintain a list of 'dynamic roots' for each possible selector we can
/// encounter. These dynamic roots are methods that are not overrides and
/// therefore are the minimal set of targets for a dynamic call to that
/// selector. This preprocessing makes handling dynamic calls very fast.
/// See [rootsForSelector].
///
/// Query phase:
/// For each query during type refinement we attempt to return as few targets as
/// possible to represent calls on a receiver type cone. We start by trying to
/// find the call that would be invoked if the call were on the root of the type
/// cone by finding a matching member on a superclass (or the class itself).
/// If we can find one then we determine if the call to this target would be
/// virtual or concrete. The call can be concrete if:
/// 1) The type cone is 'exact' so there is only one receiver class.
/// 2) The type cone is 'subclass' but none of subclasses in the cone override
///    the target.
/// 3) The target we found has no overrides so it must be the actual target.
/// See [findSuperclassTarget].
///
/// The above step produces a single target (virtual or concrete) reducing the
/// number of edges in the type graph. However, since our type masks lose some
/// precision as they get unioned, its possible that neither of those steps
/// finds a target. In these cases we finally iterate over the subclasses (or
/// subtypes for a subtype-cone) and find a set of targets that cover all
/// classes in the cone. See [findMatchingAncestors].
///
/// We handle receiver masks that include `null` as well as no such method
/// handling separately. See [rootsForCall].
///
/// All results returned from the query phase are cached on the pair of receiver
/// type and selector for use in subsequent queries.
