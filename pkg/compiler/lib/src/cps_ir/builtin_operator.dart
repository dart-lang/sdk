// This is shared by the CPS and Tree IRs.
// Both cps_ir_nodes and tree_ir_nodes import and re-export this file.

/// An operator supported natively in the CPS and Tree IRs using the
/// `ApplyBuiltinOperator` instructions.
///
/// These operators are pure in the sense that they cannot throw, diverge,
/// have observable side-effects, return new objects, nor depend on any
/// mutable state.
///
/// Most operators place restrictions on the values that may be given as
/// argument; their behaviour is unspecified if those requirements are violated.
///
/// In all cases, the word "null" refers to the Dart null object, corresponding
/// to both JS null and JS undefined.
///
/// Some operators, notably [IsFloor] and [IsNumberAndFloor], take "repeated"
/// arguments to reflect the number of times the given value is referenced
/// by the generated code. The tree IR needs to know the number of references
/// to safely propagate assignments.
