part of layout;

/// Implements a grid-based layout system based on:
/// [http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-grid-align/]
///
/// This layout is designed to support animations and work on browsers that
/// don't support grid natively. As such, we implement it on top of absolute
/// positioning.
// TODO(jmesserly): the DOM integration still needs work:
//  - The grid assumes it is absolutely positioned in its container.
//    Because of that, the grid doesn't work right unless it has at least one
//    fractional size in each dimension. In other words, only "top down" grids
//    work at the moment, because the grid can't determine its own size.
//    The core algorithm supports computing min breadth; the issue is about how
//    to integrate it into our View layer.
//  - Unless a child element is "display: inline-block" we can't get its
//    horizontal content size.
//  - Once we set an element's size to "position: absolute", we lose the
//    ability to get its original content size. If the width or height gets
//    set to something other than the content size, we can't recover the
//    original content size.
//  - There's some rounding to ints when we want to set the positions of our
//    tracks. I don't think we necessarily need to do that.
//
// TODO(jmesserly): Some features of the spec are unimplemented:
//  - grid-flow & items that have row and column set to 'auto'.
//  - Grid writing modes (right to left languages, etc)
//  - We don't do a second calculation pass if min content size of a grid-item
//    changes due to column width.
//  - The CSS parsing is not 100% complete, see the parser TODOs.
//  - We don't implement error recovery for invalid combinations of CSS
//    properties, or invalid CSS property values. Instead we throw an error.
//
// TODO(jmesserly): high level performance optimizations we could do:
//  - Optimize for the common case of spanCount = 1
//  - Optimize for the vbox/hbox case (1 row or 1 column)
//  - Optimize for the case of no content sized tracks
//  - Optimize for the "incremental update" cases
