# The dart2js compiler

Welcome to the sources of the dart2js compiler!

## Architecture

The compiler is structured to operate in several phases. By default these phases
are executed in sequence in a single process, but on some build systems, some of
these phases are split into separate processes. As such, there is plenty of
indirection and data representations used mostly for the purpose of serializing
intermediate results during compilation.

The current compiler phases are:

  1. **common front-end**: Execute traditional front-end compilation phases.
     Dart2js delegates to the common front-end (also used by DDC and the VM) to
     do all front-end features, this includes:
     *  parsing Dart source code,
     *  type checking,
     *  inferring implicit user types, like locals with a `var` declaration,
     *  lowering or simplifying Dart features. For example, this is how many
        syntactic features, like extension methods and list comprehensions, are
        implemented.
     * additional web-specific lowering or simplifications. For example,
       expansion of JS-interop features and web specific implementation of
       language features like late variables.

    The result of this phase is a kernel AST which is serialized as a `.dill`
    file.

  2. **modular analysis**: Using kernel as input, compute data recording
     properties about each method in the program, especially around dependencies
     and features they may need. We call this "impact data" (i1).

     When the compiler runs as a single process, this is done lazily/on-demand
     during the tree-shaking phase (below). However, this data can also be
     computed independently for individual methods, files, or packages in the
     application.  That makes it possible to run this modularly and in parallel.

     The result of this phase can be emitted as files containing impact data in
     a serialized format.

  3. **tree-shake and create world**: Create a model to understand what parts of
     the code are used by an application. This consists of:
        * creating an intermediate representation called the "K model" that
          wraps our kernel representation
        * calculating which classes and methods are considered live in the
          program. This is done by incrementally combining impact data (i1)
          starting from `main`, then visiting reachable methods in the program
          with an Rapid Type Analysis (RTA) algorithm to aggregate impacts
          together.

     The result of this phase is what we call a "closed world" (w1). The closed
     world is also a datastructure that can answer interesting queries, such as:
     Is this interface implemented by a single class? Is this method available
     in any subtype of some interface? The answers to these questions can help
     the compiler generate higher quality JavaScript.

  4. **global analysis**: Run a global analysis that assumes closed world
     semantics (from w1) and propagates information across method boundaries to
     further understand what values flow through the program. This phase is
     very valuable in narrowing down possibilities that are ambiguous based
     solely on type information written by developers. It often finds
     opportunities that enable the compiler to devirtualize or inline method
     calls, generate code specializations, or trigger performance optimizations.

     The result of this phase is a "global result" (g).

  5. **codegen model**: Create a JS or backend model of the program. This is an
     intermediate representation of the entities in the program we referred to
     as the "J model". It is very similar to the "K model", but it is tailored
     to model JavaScript specific concepts (like the split of constructor bodies
     as separate elements) and provide a mapping to the Dart model.

  6. **codegen**: Generate code for each method that is deemed necessary. This
     includes:
        * build an SSA graph from kernel ASTs and global results (g)
        * optimize the SSA representation
        * compute impact (i2) from optimized code
        * emit JS ASTs for the code


  7. **link tree-shake**: Using the results of codegen, we perform a second
     round of tree-shaking. This is important because code that was deemed
     reachable in (w1) may be found unreachable after optimizations. The process
     is very similar to the earlier phase: we combine incrementally the codegen
     impact data (i2) and compute a codegen closed world (w2).


     When dart2js runs as a single process the codegen phase is done lazily and
     on-demand, together with the tree-shaking phase.

  8. **emit JavaScript files**: The final step is to assemble and minify the
     final program. This includes:
     * Build a JavaScript program structure from the compiled pieces (w2)
     * Use frequency namer to minify names.
     * Emit js and source map files.

## Code organization

### Some terminology used in the compiler

  * **world**: the compiler exploits closed-world assumptions to do
    optimizations. The *world* encapsulates some of our knowledge of the
    program, like what's reachable from `main`, which classes are instantiated,
    etc.

  * **universe**: rather than loading entire programs and removing unreachable
    code, the compiler uses a tree-growing approach: it enqueues work based on
    what it sees. While this is happening the *world* is considered to be
    growing, in the past the term *universe* was used to describe this growing
    world. While the term is not completely deleted from the codebase, a lot of
    progress has been made to rename *universe* into *world builders*.

  * **model**: there are many models in the compiler:

    * **entity model**: this is an abstraction describing the elements seen in
      Dart programs, like "libraries", "classes", "methods", etc. We currently
      have two entity models, the "K model" (which is frontend centric and
      usually maps 1:1 with kernel entities) and the "J model" (which is backend
      centric).

    * **emitter model**: this is a model just used for dumping out the structure
      of the program in a .js text file. It doesn't have enough semantic meaning
      to be a JS model for compilation, which is why there is a separate "J
      model".

  * **enqueuer**: a work-queue used to achieve tree-shaking (or more precisely
    tree-growing): elements are added to the enqueuer as we recognize that they
    are needed in a given application (as described by the impact data). Note
    that we even track how elements are used, since some ways of using an
    element require more code than others.

### Code layout

Here are some details of our current code layout and what's in each file. This
list also includes some action items (labeled AI below), which are mainly
cleanup tasks that we have been discussing for a while:

**bin folder**: some experimental command-line entrypoints, these need to be
revisited

* `bin/dart2js.dart`: is a dart2js entry point, not used today other than
  locally for development, most of our tools launch dart2js from
  `lib/src/dart2js.dart` instead.

  AI: change how we build the SDK to launch dart2js from here, most logic might
  remain inside `lib/src/dart2js.dart` for testing purposes.

**lib folder**: API to use dart2js as a library. This is used by our
command-line tool to launch dart2js, but also by pub to invoke dart2js as a
library during `pub-build` and `pub-serve`.

* `lib/compiler_api.dart`: the compiler API. This API is used by our
  command-line tool to spawn the dart2js compiler. This API (and everything that
  is transitively created from it) has no dependencies on `dart:io` so that the
  compiler can be used in contexts where `dart:io` is not available (e.g.
  running in a browser worker) or where `dart:io` is not used explicitly (e.g.
  running as a pub transformer).

**lib/src folder**: most of the compiler lives here, as very little of its
functionality is publicly exposed.


* `lib/src/dart2js.dart`: the command-line script that runs dart2js. When
  building the SDK, the dart2js snapshot is built using the main method on this
  script.  This file creates the parameters needed to invoke the API defined in
  `lib/compiler.dart`. All dependencies on `dart:io` come from here. This is
  also where we process options (although some of the logic is done in
  `options.dart`).

* `lib/src/compiler.dart`: defines the core `Compiler` object, which contains
  all the logic about what the compiler pipeline does and how data is organized
  and communicated between different phases.

* `lib/src/closure.dart`: closures are compiled as classes, this file has the
  logic to do this kind of conversion in the Dart element model. This includes
  computing what needs to be boxed and creating fake element models to represent
  closures as classes. We use the fake model approach because the compiler
  currently uses the same element model for Dart and JS. Our goal with the
  compiler rearchitecture described earlier is to have two models. The
  Dart model will be able to encode closures directly, and we'll introduce their
  corresponding classes when we create the corresponding JS model, removing the
  need of the fake elements.

* `lib/src/colors.dart`: ANSI support for reporting error messages with colors.

  AI: this file should move under a utilities folder.


* Handling of options: as mentioned earlier `lib/src/dart2js.dart` has some
  handling of command-line options, the rest is divided into these files:

  * `lib/src/commandline_options.dart`: defines the flags that dart2js accepts.

  * `lib/src/options.dart`: defines first-class objects to represent options of
    dart2js. This includes a parse function that can translate flags into their
    corresponding objects. This was added recently to simplify how options were
    propagated throughout the compiler.

  AI: simplify further how we specify options. Ideally all changes can be done
  in a single file (`options.dart`?), and unit-tests can specify options via an
  options object rather than command-line flags.

* `lib/src/common.dart`: convenience file that reexports code used in many
  places in the compiler.

  AI: consider deleting this file.


* Constants: the compiler has a constant system that evaluates constant
  expressions based on JS semantics.

  * `lib/src/constants/value.dart`: this is the represented value of a constant
    after it has been evaluated.

  * `lib/src/constants/constant_system.dart`: implements evaluating constant
    Dart expressions and produces values.

* Common elements: the compiler often refers to certain elements during
  compilation either because they are first-class in the language or because
  they are implicitly used to implement some features. These include:

  * `lib/src/common/elements.dart`: provides an interface to lookup basic
    elements like the class of `Object`, `int`, `List`, and their corresponding
    interface types, constructors for symbols, annotations such as the `identical` function. These are normally restricted
    to elements that are understood directly in Dart.

  * `lib/src/js_backend/backend_helpers.dart`: provides a way to lookup internal
    elements of the JavaScript backend, like our internal
    representation of JSInt31, JSArray, and other implementation-specific
    elements.

* `lib/src/deferred_load/deferred_load.dart`: general analysis for deferred
  loading. This is where we compute how to split the code in different JS chunks
  or fragments.  This is run after resolution, but at a time when no code is
  generated yet, so the decisions made here are used later on by the emitter to
  dump code into different files.

* `lib/src/dump_info.dart`: a special phase used to create a .info.json file.
  This file contains lots of information computed by dart2js including decisions
  about deferred loading, results of the global type-inference, and the actual
  code generated for each function. The output is used by tools provided in the
  `dart2js_info` package to analyze a program and better understand why
  something wasn't optimized as you'd expect.

* Tree-shaking: The compiler does two phases of reducing the program size by
  throwing away unreachable code. The first phase is done while resolving the
  program (reachability is basically based on dependencies that appear in the
  code), the second phase is done as functions are optimized (which in turn can
  delete branches of the code and make more code unreachable). Externally
  we refer to it as tree-shaking, but it behaves more like a tree-growing
  algorithm: elements are added as they are discovered or as they are used.
  On some large apps we've seen 50% of code tree-shaken: 20% from the first
  phase, and an additional 30% from the second phase.

  * `lib/src/enqueue.dart`: this is the basic algorithm that adds things as they
    are discovered during resolution.

  * `lib/src/js_backend/enqueuer.dart`: this is the enqueuer used during code
    generation.

* `lib/src/environment.dart`: simple interface for collecting environment values
  (these are values passed via -D flags on the command line).

* `lib/src/filenames.dart`: basic support for converting between native and Uri
  paths.

  AI: move to utils

* `lib/src/id_generator.dart`: simple id generator

  AI: move to utils

* `lib/src/library_loader.dart`: the loader of the dart2js frontend. Asks the
  compiler to read and scan files, produce enough metadata to understand
  import, export, and part directives and keep crawling. It also triggers the
  patch parser to load patch files.

* Input/output: the compiler is designed to avoid all dependencies on dart:io.
  Most data is consumed and emitted via provider APIs.

  * `lib/src/compiler.dart`: defines the interface of these providers (see
    `CompilerInput` and `CompilerOutput`).

  * `lib/src/null_compiler_output.dart`: a `CompilerOutput` that discards all
    data written to it (name derives from /dev/null).

  * `lib/src/source_file_provider.dart`: _TODO: add details_.

* Parsing: most of the parsing logic is now in the `front_end` package,
  currently under `pkg/front_end/lib/src/fasta/scanner` and
  `pkg/front_end/lib/src/fasta/parser`. The `front_end` parser is AST agnostic
  and uses listeners to create on the side what they want as the result of
  parsing. The logic to create dart2js' ASTs is defined in listeners within the
  compiler package:

  * `lib/src/parser/element_listener.dart`: listener used to create the first
    skeleton of the element model (used by the diet parser)

  * `lib/src/parser/partial_elements.dart`: representation of elements in the
    element model whose body is not parsed yet (e.g. a diet-parsed member).

  * `lib/src/parser/node_listener.dart`: listener used to create the body of
    methods.

  * `lib/src/parser/member_listener.dart`: listener used to attach method bodies
    to class members.

  * `lib/src/parser/parser_task.dart`: Task to execute the full parser.

  * `lib/src/parser/diet_parser_task.dart`: Task to execute diet parsing.

  * `lib/src/patch_parser.dart`: additional support for parsing patch files. We
    expect this will also move under `front_end` in the future.


* URI resolution: the compiler needs special logic to resolve `dart:*` URIs and
  `package:*` URIs. These are specified in three parts:

  * sdk library files are specified in a .platform file. This file has a special
    .ini format which is parsed with `lib/src/platform_configuration.dart`.

  * sdk patch files are hardcoded in the codebase in
    `lib/src/js_backend/backend.dart` (see `_patchLocations`).

  * `lib/src/resolved_uri_translator.dart`: has the logic to translate all these
    URIs when they are encountered by the library loader.

  AI: consider changing the .platform file format to yaml.


* `lib/src/typechecker.dart`: the type checker (spec mode semantics, no support
  for strong mode here).

* World: _TODO: add details_

  * `lib/src/world.dart`
  * `lib/src/universe/call_structure.dart`

* Testing, debugging, and what not: _TODO: add details_
  * `lib/src/tracer.dart`
  * `lib/src/use_unused_api.dart`

  JavaScript. _TODO: add details_.

  * `ssa_branch_builder.dart`
  * `value_range_analyzer.dart`
  * `ssa_tracer.dart`
  * `loop_handler.dart`

* `tool`: some helper scripts, some of these could be deleted

  * `tool/perf.dart`: used by our benchmark runners to measure performance of
    some frontend pieces of dart2js. We should be able to delete it in the near
    future once the front end code is moved into `fasta`.

  * `tool/perf_test.dart`: small test to ensure we don't break `perf.dart`.

  * `tool/track_memory.dart`: a helper script to see memory usage of dart2js
    while it's running. Used in the past to profile the global analysis phases
    when run on very large apps.

  * `tool/dart2js_stress.dart` and `tool/dart2js_profile_many.dart`: other
    helper wrappers to make it easier to profile dart2js with Observatory.

* Source map tracking (`lib/src/io`): helpers used to track source information
  and to build source map files. _TODO: add details_.
   * `lib/src/io/code_output.dart`

   * `lib/src/io/line_column_provider.dart`

* Kernel conversion (`lib/src/kernel`): temporary code to create kernel within
  dart2js (previously known as `rasta`). Most of this code will be gone when we
  are in the final architecture. _TODO: add details_.
   * `lib/src/kernel/task.dart`
   * `lib/src/kernel/kernel_visitor.dart`

   * `lib/src/kernel/accessors.dart`
   * `lib/src/kernel/constant_visitor.dart`
   * `lib/src/kernel/error.dart`

* Global whole-program analysis (a.k.a. type inference): We try to avoid the
  term "type inference" to avoid confusion with strong-mode type inference.
  However the code still uses the term inference for this global analysis. The
  code is contained under `lib/src/inferrer`. _TODO: add details_.
   * `lib/src/inferrer/type_graph_dump.dart`
