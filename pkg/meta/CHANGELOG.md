## 1.1.5

* Introduce @isTest and @isTestGroup to declare a function that is a
  test, or a test group.

## 1.1.4

* Added dart2js.dart.

## 1.1.2

* Rollback SDK constraint update for 2.0.0. No longer needed.

## 1.1.1

* Update SDK constraint to be 2.0.0 dev friendly.

## 1.1.0

* Introduce `@alwaysThrows` to declare that a function always throws
    (SDK issue [17999](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/17999)). This
    is first available in Dart SDK 1.25.0-dev.1.0.

    ```dart
    import 'package:meta/meta.dart';

    // Without knowing that [failBigTime] always throws, it looks like this
    // function might return without returning a bool.
    bool fn(expected, actual) {
      if (expected != actual)
        failBigTime(expected, actual);
      else
        return True;
    }

    @alwaysThrows
    void failBigTime(expected, actual) {
      throw new StateError('Expected $expected, but was $actual.');
    }
    ```

## 1.0.5

* Introduce `@experimental` to annotate a library, or any declaration that is
  part of the public interface of a library (such as top-level members, class
  members, and function parameters) to indicate that the annotated API is
  experimental and may be removed or changed at any-time without updating the
  version of the containing package, despite the fact that it would otherwise
  be a breaking change.

## 1.0.4

* Introduce `@virtual` to allow field overrides in strong mode
    (SDK issue [27384](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/27384)).

    ```dart
    import 'package:meta/meta.dart' show virtual;
    class Base {
      @virtual int x;
    }
    class Derived extends Base {
      int x;

      // Expose the hidden storage slot:
      int get superX => super.x;
      set superX(int v) { super.x = v; }
    }
    ```

## 1.0.3

* Introduce `@checked` to override a method and tighten a parameter
    type (SDK issue [25578](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/25578)).

    ```dart
    import 'package:meta/meta.dart' show checked;
    class View {
      addChild(View v) {}
    }
    class MyView extends View {
      // this override is legal, it will check at runtime if we actually
      // got a MyView.
      addChild(@checked MyView v) {}
    }
    main() {
      dynamic mv = new MyView();
      mv.addChild(new View()); // runtime error
    }
    ```

## 1.0.2

* Introduce `@visibleForTesting` annotation for declarations that may be referenced only in the library or in a test.

## 1.0.1

* Updated `@factory` to allow statics and methods returning `null`.

## 1.0.0

* First stable API release.

## 0.12.2

* Updated `@protected` to include implemented interfaces (linter#252).

## 0.12.1

* Fixed markdown in dartdocs.

## 0.12.0

* Introduce `@optionalTypeArgs` annotation for classes whose type arguments are to be treated as optional.

## 0.11.0

* Added new `Required` constructor with a means to specify a reason to explain why a parameter is required.

## 0.10.0

* Introduce `@factory` annotation for methods that must either be abstract or must return a newly allocated object.
* Introduce `@literal` annotation that indicates that any invocation of a
constructor must use the keyword `const` unless one or more of the
arguments to the constructor is not a compile-time constant.

## 0.9.0

* Introduce `@protected` annotation for members that must only be called from
instance members of subclasses.
* Introduce `@required` annotation for optional parameters that should be treated
as required.
* Introduce `@mustCallSuper` annotation for methods that must be invoked by all
overriding methods.
