# Annotations for Static Analysis

This package defines annotations that can be used by the tools that are shipped
with the Dart SDK.

## Library Structure

The annotations in this package are defined in two libraries.

The library in `meta.dart` defines annotations that can be used by static
analysis tools to provide a more complete analysis of the code that uses them.
Within the SDK, these tools include the command-line analyzer (`dart analyze`)
and the analysis server that is used to power many of the Dart-enabled
development tools.

The library in `dart2js.dart` defines annotations that provide hints to dart2js
to improve the quality of the JavaScript code that it produces. These
annotations are currently experimental and might be removed in a future version
of this package.
