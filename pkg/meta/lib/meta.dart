/// Used to annotate a function `f`. Indicates that `f` always throws an
/// exception. Any functions that override `f`, in class inheritence, are also
/// expected to conform to this contract.
///
/// Tools, such as the analyzer, can use this to understand whether a block of
/// code "exits". For example:
///
/// ```dart
/// @alwaysThrows toss() { throw 'Thrown'; }
///
/// int fn(bool b) {
///   if (b) {
///     return 0;
///   } else {
///     toss();
///     print("Hello.");
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Without the annotation on `toss`, it would look as though `fn` doesn't
/// always return a value. The annotation shows that `fn` does always exit. In
/// addition, the annotation reveals that any statements following a call to
/// `toss` (like the `print` call) are dead code.
///
/// Tools, such as the analyzer, can also expect this contract to be enforced;
/// that is, tools may emit warnings if a function with this annotation
/// _doesn't_ always throw.

///
/// Indicates that this parameter may have a tighter type than the parameter on

/// is a subtype of the overridden parameter type.
///
/// DEPRECATED: Use the `covariant` modifier instead.
