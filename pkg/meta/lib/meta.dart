/// exception. Any functions that override `f`, in class inheritance, are also

///
/// Tools, such as the analyzer, can use this to understand whether a block of
/// code "exits". For example:
///
/// ```dart
/// @alwaysThrows toss() { throw 'Thrown'; }
///
/// int fn(bool b) {
///   if (b) {
///     return 0;
///   } else {

/// Without the annotation on `toss`, it would look as though `fn` doesn't
/// always return a value. The annotation shows that `fn` does always exit. In
/// addition, the annotation reveals that any statements following a call to
/// `toss` (like the `print` call) are dead code.
