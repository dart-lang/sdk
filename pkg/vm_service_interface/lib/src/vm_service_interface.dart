  /// line numbers. This is designed to reduce the number of RPCs that need to
  /// be performed in the case that the client is only interested in line
  /// numbers. If this parameter is not provided, it is considered to have the

  /// The `libraryFilters` parameter is intended to be used when gathering
  /// coverage for the whole isolate. If it is provided, the `SourceReport` will

  /// filter strings. For example, pass `["package:foo/"]` to only include
