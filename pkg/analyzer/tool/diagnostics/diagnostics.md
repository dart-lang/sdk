This page lists diagnostic messages produced by the Dart analyzer,
with details about what those messages mean and how you can fix your code.
For more information about the analyzer, see
[Customizing static analysis](/guides/language/analysis-options).

## Glossary

This page uses the following terms.

### Constant context

A _constant context_ is a region of code in which it isn't necessary to include
the `const` keyword because it's implied by the fact that everything in that
region is required to be a constant. The following locations are constant
contexts:

* Everything inside a list, map or set literal that's prefixed by the
  `const` keyword. Example:

  ```dart
  var l = const [/*constant context*/];
  ```

* The arguments inside an invocation of a constant constructor. Example:

  ```dart
  var p = const Point(/*constant context*/);
  ```

* The initializer for a variable that's prefixed by the `const` keyword.
  Example:

  ```dart
  const v = /*constant context*/;
  ```

* Annotations

* The expression in a case clause. Example:

  ```dart
  void f(int e) {
    switch (e) {
      case /*constant context*/:
        break;
    }
  }
  ```

## Diagnostics

The analyzer produces the following diagnostics for code that
doesn't conform to the language specification or
that might work in unexpected ways.

### ambiguous_set_or_map_literal_both

_This literal contains both 'Map' and 'Iterable' spreads, which makes it
impossible to determine whether the literal is a map or a set._

#### Description

Because map and set literals use the same delimiters (`{` and `}`), the
analyzer looks at the type arguments and the elements to determine which
kind of literal you meant. When there are no type arguments and all of the
elements are spread elements (which are allowed in both kinds of literals),
then the analyzer uses the types of the expressions that are being spread.
If all of the expressions have the type `Iterable`, then it's a set
literal; if they all have the type `Map`, then it's a map literal.

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when some of the expressions being
spread have the type `Iterable` and others have the type `Map`, making it
impossible for the analyzer to determine whether you are writing a map
literal or a set literal.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic:

{% prettify dart %}
union(Map<String, String> a, List<String> b, Map<String, String> c) =>
    [!{...a, ...b, ...c}!];
{% endprettify %}

The list `b` can only be spread into a set, and the maps `a` and `c` can
only be spread into a map, and the literal can't be both.

#### Common fixes

There are two common ways to fix this problem. The first is to remove all
of the spread elements of one kind or another, so that the elements are
consistent. In this case, that likely means removing the list and deciding
what to do about the now unused parameter:

{% prettify dart %}
union(Map<String, String> a, List<String> b, Map<String, String> c) =>
    {...a, ...c};
{% endprettify %}

The second fix is to change the elements of one kind into elements that are
consistent with the other elements. For example, you can add the elements
of the list as keys that map to themselves:

{% prettify dart %}
union(Map<String, String> a, List<String> b, Map<String, String> c) =>
    {...a, for (String s in b) s: s, ...c};
{% endprettify %}

### ambiguous_set_or_map_literal_either

_This literal must be either a map or a set, but the elements don't have enough
information for type inference to work._

#### Description

Because map and set literals use the same delimiters (`{` and `}`), the
analyzer looks at the type arguments and the elements to determine which
kind of literal you meant. When there are no type arguments and all of the
elements are spread elements (which are allowed in both kinds of literals)
then the analyzer uses the types of the expressions that are being spread.
If all of the expressions have the type `Iterable`, then it's a set
literal; if they all have the type `Map`, then it's a map literal.

This diagnostic is produced when none of the expressions being spread have
a type that allows the analyzer to decide whether you were writing a map
literal or a set literal.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic:

{% prettify dart %}
union(a, b) => [!{...a, ...b}!];
{% endprettify %}

The problem occurs because there are no type arguments, and there is no
information about the type of either `a` or `b`.

#### Common fixes

There are three common ways to fix this problem. The first is to add type
arguments to the literal. For example, if the literal is intended to be a
map literal, you might write something like this:

{% prettify dart %}
union(a, b) => <String, String>{...a, ...b};
{% endprettify %}

The second fix is to add type information so that the expressions have
either the type `Iterable` or the type `Map`. You can add an explicit cast
or, in this case, add types to the declarations of the two parameters:

{% prettify dart %}
union(List<int> a, List<int> b) => {...a, ...b};
{% endprettify %}

The third fix is to add context information. In this case, that means
adding a return type to the function:

{% prettify dart %}
Set<String> union(a, b) => {...a, ...b};
{% endprettify %}

In other cases, you might add a type somewhere else. For example, say the
original code looks like this:

{% prettify dart %}
union(a, b) {
  var x = [!{...a, ...b}!];
  return x;
}
{% endprettify %}

You might add a type annotation on `x`, like this:

{% prettify dart %}
union(a, b) {
  Map<String, String> x = {...a, ...b};
  return x;
}
{% endprettify %}

### argument_type_not_assignable

_The argument type '{0}' can't be assigned to the parameter type '{1}'._

#### Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the static type of an argument
can't be assigned to the static type of the corresponding parameter.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic:

{% prettify dart %}
String f(String x) => x;
String g(num y) => f([!y!]);
{% endprettify %}

#### Common fixes

If possible, rewrite the code so that the static type is assignable. In the
example above you might be able to change the type of the parameter `y`:

{% prettify dart %}
String f(String x) => x;
String g(String y) => f(y);
{% endprettify %}

If that fix isn't possible, then add code to handle the case where the
argument value isn't the required type. One approach is to coerce other
types to the required type:

{% prettify dart %}
String f(String x) => x;
String g(num y) => f(y.toString());
{% endprettify %}

Another approach is to add explicit type tests and fallback code:

{% prettify dart %}
String f(String x) => x;
String g(num y) => f(y is String ? y : '');
{% endprettify %}

If you believe that the runtime type of the argument will always be the
same as the static type of the parameter, and you're willing to risk having
an exception thrown at runtime if you're wrong, then add an explicit cast:

{% prettify dart %}
String f(String x) => x;
String g(num y) => f(y as String);
{% endprettify %}

### const_initialized_with_non_constant_value

_Const variables must be initialized with a constant value._

#### Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a value that isn't statically
known to be a constant is assigned to a variable that's declared to be a
'const' variable.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because `x` isn't declared to
be `const`:

{% prettify dart %}
var x = 0;
const y = [!x!];
{% endprettify %}

#### Common fixes

If the value being assigned can be declared to be `const`, then change the
declaration:

{% prettify dart %}
const x = 0;
const y = x;
{% endprettify %}

If the value can't be declared to be `const`, then remove the `const`
modifier from the variable, possibly using `final` in its place:

{% prettify dart %}
var x = 0;
final y = x;
{% endprettify %}

### deprecated_member_use

_'{0}' is deprecated and shouldn't be used._

#### Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a deprecated library or class
member is used in a different package.

#### Example

If the method `m` in the class `C` is annotated with `@deprecated`, then
the following code produces this diagnostic:

{% prettify dart %}
void f(C c) {
  c.[!m!]();
}
{% endprettify %}

#### Common fixes

The documentation for declarations that are annotated with `@deprecated`
should indicate what code to use in place of the deprecated code.

### deprecated_member_use_from_same_package

_'{0}' is deprecated and shouldn't be used._

#### Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a deprecated library member or
class member is used in the same package in which it's declared.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic:

{% prettify dart %}
@deprecated
var x = 0;
var y = [!x!];
{% endprettify %}

#### Common fixes

The fix depends on what's been deprecated and what the replacement is. The
documentation for deprecated declarations should indicate what code to use
in place of the deprecated code.

### equal_keys_in_const_map

_Two keys in a constant map literal can't be equal._

#### Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a key in a constant map is the
same as a previous key in the same map. If two keys are the same, then the
second value would overwrite the first value, which makes having both pairs
pointless.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic:

{% prettify dart %}
const map = <int, String>{1: 'a', 2: 'b', [!1!]: 'c', 4: 'd'};
{% endprettify %}

#### Common fixes

If one of the keys was supposed to be different, then replace it:

{% prettify dart %}
const map = <int, String>{1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 'c', 4: 'd'};
{% endprettify %}

Otherwise, remove the key/value pair that isn't intended to be in the map:

{% prettify dart %}
const map = <int, String>{1: 'a', 2: 'b', 4: 'd'};
{% endprettify %}

### expression_in_map

_Expressions can't be used in a map literal._

#### Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the analyzer finds an
expression, rather than a map entry, in what appears to be a map literal.

#### Example

The following code generates this diagnostic:

{% prettify dart %}
var map = <String, int>{'a': 0, 'b': 1, [!'c'!]};
{% endprettify %}

#### Common fixes

If the expression is intended to compute either a key or a value in an
entry, fix the issue by replacing the expression with the key or the value.
For example:

{% prettify dart %}
var map = <String, int>{'a': 0, 'b': 1, 'c': 2};
{% endprettify %}

### invalid_literal_annotation

_Only const constructors can have the `@literal` annotation._

#### Description

The meaning of the `@literal` annotation is only defined when it's applied
to a const constructor.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic:

{% prettify dart %}
import 'package:meta/meta.dart';

[!@literal!]
var x;
{% endprettify %}

#### Common fixes

Remove the annotation:

{% prettify dart %}
var x;
{% endprettify %}

### invocation_of_non_function

_'{0}' isn't a function._

#### Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when it finds a function invocation,
but the name of the function being invoked is defined to be something other
than a function.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic:

{% prettify dart %}
typedef Binary = int Function(int, int);

int f() {
  return [!Binary!](1, 2);
}
{% endprettify %}

#### Common fixes

Replace the name with the name of a function.

### missing_return

_This function has a return type of '{0}', but doesn't end with a return
statement._

#### Description

Any function or method that doesn’t end with either an explicit return or a
throw implicitly returns `null`. This is rarely the desired behavior. The
analyzer produces this diagnostic when it finds an implicit return.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic:

{% prettify dart %}
[!int!] f(int x) {
  if (x < 0) {
    return 0;
  }
}
{% endprettify %}

#### Common fixes

Add a return statement that makes the return value explicit, even if `null`
is the appropriate value.

### non_constant_list_element

_The values in a const list literal must be constants._

#### Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an element in a constant list
literal isn't a constant value. The list literal can be constant either
explicitly (because it's prefixed by the `const` keyword) or implicitly
(because it appears in a [constant context](#constant-context)).

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because `x` isn't a constant,
even though it appears in an implicitly constant list literal:

{% prettify dart %}
var x = 2;
var y = const <int>[0, 1, [!x!]];
{% endprettify %}

#### Common fixes

If the list needs to be a constant list, then convert the element to be a
constant. In the example above, you might add the `const` keyword to the
declaration of `x`:

{% prettify dart %}
const x = 2;
var y = const <int>[0, 1, x];
{% endprettify %}

If the expression can't be made a constant, then the list can't be a
constant either, so you must change the code so that the list isn't a
constant. In the example above this means removing the `const` keyword
before the list literal:

{% prettify dart %}
var x = 2;
var y = <int>[0, 1, x];
{% endprettify %}

### non_type_as_type_argument

_The name '{0}' isn't a type so it can't be used as a type argument._

#### Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an identifier that isn't a type
is used as a type argument.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because `x` is a variable, not
a type:

{% prettify dart %}
var x = 0;
List<[!x!]> xList = [];
{% endprettify %}

#### Common fixes

Change the type argument to be a type:

{% prettify dart %}
var x = 0;
List<int> xList = [];
{% endprettify %}

### not_a_type

_{0} isn't a type._

#### Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a name is used as a type but
declared to be something other than a type.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because `f` is a function:

{% prettify dart %}
f() {}
g([!f!] v) {}
{% endprettify %}

#### Common fixes

Replace the name with the name of a type.

### not_iterable_spread

_Spread elements in list or set literals must implement 'Iterable'._

#### Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the static type of the
expression of a spread element that appears in either a list literal or a
set literal doesn't implement the type `Iterable`.

#### Example

The following code generates this diagnostic:

{% prettify dart %}
var m = <String, int>{'a': 0, 'b': 1};
var s = <String>{...[!m!]};
{% endprettify %}

#### Common fixes

The most common fix is to replace the expression with one that produces an
iterable object:

{% prettify dart %}
var m = <String, int>{'a': 0, 'b': 1};
var s = <String>{...m.keys};
{% endprettify %}

### redirect_to_non_class

_The name '{0}' isn't a type and can't be used in a redirected constructor._

#### Description

One way to implement a factory constructor is to redirect to another
constructor by referencing the name of the constructor. The analyzer
produces this diagnostic when the redirect is to something other than a
constructor.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because `f` is a function:

{% prettify dart %}
C f() => null;

class C {
  factory C() = [!f!];
}
{% endprettify %}

#### Common fixes

If the constructor isn't defined, then either define it or replace it with
a constructor that is defined.

If the constructor is defined but the class that defines it isn't visible,
then you probably need to add an import.

If you're trying to return the value returned by a function, then rewrite
the constructor to return the value from the constructor's body:

{% prettify dart %}
C f() => null;

class C {
  factory C() => f();
}
{% endprettify %}

### sdk_version_set_literal

_Set literals weren't supported until version 2.2, but this code is required to
be able to run on earlier versions._

#### Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a set literal is found in code
that has an SDK constraint whose lower bound is less than 2.2. Set literals
weren't supported in earlier versions, so this code won't be able to run
against earlier versions of the SDK.

#### Example

Here's an example of a pubspec that defines an SDK constraint with a lower
bound of less than 2.2:

```yaml
environment:
  sdk: '>=2.1.0 <2.4.0'
```

In the package that has that pubspec, code like the following produces this
diagnostic:

{% prettify dart %}
var s = [!<int>{}!];
{% endprettify %}

#### Common fixes

If you don't need to support older versions of the SDK, then you can
increase the SDK constraint to allow the syntax to be used:

```yaml
environment:
  sdk: '>=2.2.0 <2.4.0'
```

If you do need to support older versions of the SDK, then replace the set
literal with code that creates the set without the use of a literal:

{% prettify dart %}
var s = new Set<int>();
{% endprettify %}

### type_argument_not_matching_bounds

_'{0}' doesn't extend '{1}'._

#### Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a type argument isn't the same
as or a subclass of the bounds of the corresponding type parameter.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic:

{% prettify dart %}
class A<E extends num> {}

var a = A<[!String!]>();
{% endprettify %}

#### Common fixes

Change the type argument to be a subclass of the bounds:

{% prettify dart %}
class A<E extends num> {}

var a = A<int>();
{% endprettify %}

### undefined_class

_Undefined class '{0}'._

#### Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when it encounters an identifier that
appears to be the name of a class but either isn't defined or isn't visible
in the scope in which it's being referenced.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic:

{% prettify dart %}
class Point {}

void f([!Piont!] p) {}
{% endprettify %}

#### Common fixes

If the identifier isn't defined, then either define it or replace it with
the name of a class that is defined. The example above can be corrected by
fixing the spelling of the class:

{% prettify dart %}
class Point {}

void f(Point p) {}
{% endprettify %}

If the class is defined but isn't visible, then you probably need to add an
import.

### undefined_function

_The function '{0}' isn't defined._

#### Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when it encounters an identifier that
appears to be the name of a function but either isn't defined or isn't
visible in the scope in which it's being referenced.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic:

{% prettify dart %}
List<int> empty() => [];

void main() {
  print([!emty!]());
}
{% endprettify %}

#### Common fixes

If the identifier isn't defined, then either define it or replace it with
the name of a function that is defined. The example above can be corrected
by fixing the spelling of the function:

{% prettify dart %}
List<int> empty() => [];

void main() {
  print(empty());
}
{% endprettify %}

If the function is defined but isn't visible, then you probably need to add
an import or re-arrange your code to make the function visible.

### undefined_getter

_The getter '{0}' isn't defined for the class '{1}'._

#### Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when it encounters an identifier that
appears to be the name of a getter but either isn't defined or isn't
visible in the scope in which it's being referenced.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic:

{% prettify dart %}
int f(String s) => s.[!len!];
{% endprettify %}

#### Common fixes

If the identifier isn't defined, then either define it or replace it with
the name of a getter that is defined. The example above can be corrected by
fixing the spelling of the getter:

{% prettify dart %}
int f(String s) => s.length;
{% endprettify %}

### undefined_identifier

_Undefined name '{0}'._

#### Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when it encounters an identifier that
either isn't defined or isn't visible in the scope in which it's being
referenced.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic:

{% prettify dart %}
int min(int left, int right) => left <= [!rihgt!] ? left : right;
{% endprettify %}

#### Common fixes

If the identifier isn't defined, then either define it or replace it with
an identifier that is defined. The example above can be corrected by
fixing the spelling of the variable:

{% prettify dart %}
int min(int left, int right) => left <= right ? left : right;
{% endprettify %}

If the identifier is defined but isn't visible, then you probably need to
add an import or re-arrange your code to make the identifier visible.

### undefined_method

_The method '{0}' isn't defined for the class '{1}'._

#### Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when it encounters an identifier that
appears to be the name of a method but either isn't defined or isn't
visible in the scope in which it's being referenced.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic:

{% prettify dart %}
int f(List<int> l) => l.[!removeMiddle!]();
{% endprettify %}

#### Common fixes

If the identifier isn't defined, then either define it or replace it with
the name of a method that is defined. The example above can be corrected by
fixing the spelling of the method:

{% prettify dart %}
int f(List<int> l) => l.removeLast();
{% endprettify %}

### undefined_named_parameter

_The named parameter '{0}' isn't defined._

#### Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a method or function invocation
has a named argument, but the method or function being invoked doesn’t
define a parameter with the same name.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic:

{% prettify dart %}
class C {
  m({int b}) {}
}

void f(C c) {
  c.m([!a!]: 1);
}
{% endprettify %}

#### Common fixes

If the argument name is mistyped, then replace it with the correct name.
The example above can be fixed by changing `a` to `b`:

{% prettify dart %}
class C {
  m({int b}) {}
}

void f(C c) {
  c.m(b: 1);
}
{% endprettify %}

If a subclass adds a parameter with the name in question, then cast the
target to the subclass:

{% prettify dart %}
class C {
  m({int b}) {}
}

class D extends C {
  m({int a, int b}) {}
}

void f(C c) {
  (c as D).m(a: 1);
}
{% endprettify %}

If the parameter should be added to the function, then add it:

{% prettify dart %}
class C {
  m({int a, int b}) {}
}

void f(C c) {
  c.m(a: 1);
}
{% endprettify %}

### undefined_setter

_The setter '{0}' isn't defined for the class '{1}'._

#### Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when it encounters an identifier that
appears to be the name of a setter but either isn't defined or isn't
visible in the scope in which the identifier is being referenced.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic:

{% prettify dart %}
class C {
  int x = 0;
  void foo(int y) {
    this.[!z!] = y;
  }
}
{% endprettify %}

#### Common fixes

If the identifier isn't defined, then either define it or replace it with
the name of a setter that is defined. The example above can be corrected by
fixing the spelling of the setter:

{% prettify dart %}
class C {
  int x = 0;
  void foo(int y) {
    this.x = y;
  }
}
{% endprettify %}

### unused_element

_The declaration '{0}' isn't referenced._

#### Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a private class, enum, mixin,
typedef, top level variable, top level function, or method is declared but
never referenced.

#### Example

Assuming that no code in the library references `_C`, the following code
produces this diagnostic:

{% prettify dart %}
class [!_C!] {}
{% endprettify %}

#### Common fixes

If the declaration isn't needed, then remove it.

If the declaration was intended to be used, then add the missing code.

### unused_field

_The value of the field '{0}' isn't used._

#### Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a private field is declared but
never read, even if it's written in one or more places.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic:

{% prettify dart %}
class Point {
  int [!_x!];
}
{% endprettify %}

#### Common fixes

If the field isn't needed, then remove it.

If the field was intended to be used, then add the missing code.

### unused_import

_Unused import: '{0}'._

#### Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an import isn't needed because
none of the names that are imported are referenced within the importing
library.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic:

{% prettify dart %}
import [!'dart:async'!];

void main() {}
{% endprettify %}

#### Common fixes

If the import isn't needed, then remove it.

If some of the imported names are intended to be used, then add the missing
code.

### unused_local_variable

_The value of the local variable '{0}' isn't used._

#### Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a local variable is declared but
never read, even if it's written in one or more places.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic:

{% prettify dart %}
void main() {
  int [!count!] = 0;
}
{% endprettify %}

#### Common fixes

If the variable isn't needed, then remove it.

If the variable was intended to be used, then add the missing code.

### uri_does_not_exist

_Target of URI doesn't exist: '{0}'._

#### Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an import, export, or part
directive is found where the URI refers to a file that doesn't exist.

#### Example

If the file `lib.dart` doesn't exist, the following code produces this
diagnostic:

{% prettify dart %}
import [!'lib.dart'!];
{% endprettify %}

#### Common fixes

If the URI was mistyped or invalid, then correct the URI.

If the URI is correct, then create the file.

### uri_has_not_been_generated

_Target of URI hasn't been generated: '{0}'._

#### Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an import, export, or part
directive is found where the URI refers to a file that doesn't exist and
the name of the file ends with a pattern that's commonly produced by code
generators, such as one of the following:
- `.g.dart`
- `.pb.dart`
- `.pbenum.dart`
- `.pbserver.dart`
- `.pbjson.dart`
- `.template.dart`

#### Example

If the file `lib.g.dart` doesn't exist, the following code produces this
diagnostic:

{% prettify dart %}
import [!'lib.g.dart'!];
{% endprettify %}

#### Common fixes

If the file is a generated file, then run the generator that generates the
file.

If the file isn't a generated file, then check the spelling of the URI or
create the file.
