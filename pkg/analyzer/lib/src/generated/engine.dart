/// A context in which a single analysis can be performed and incrementally
/// maintained. The context includes such information as the version of the SDK
/// being analyzed against, and how to resolve 'package:' URI's. (Both of which
/// are known indirectly through the [SourceFactory].)
///
/// An analysis context also represents the state of the analysis, which includes
/// knowing which sources have been included in the analysis (either directly or
/// indirectly) and the results of the analysis. Sources must be added and
/// removed from the context using the method [applyChanges], which is also used
/// to notify the context when sources have been modified and, consequently,
/// previously known results might have been invalidated.
///
/// There are two ways to access the results of the analysis. The most common is
/// to use one of the 'get' methods to access the results. The 'get' methods have
/// the advantage that they will always return quickly, but have the disadvantage
/// that if the results are not currently available they will return either
/// nothing or in some cases an incomplete result. The second way to access
/// results is by using one of the 'compute' methods. The 'compute' methods will
/// always attempt to compute the requested results but might block the caller
/// for a significant period of time.
///
/// When results have been invalidated, have never been computed (as is the case
/// for newly added sources), or have been removed from the cache, they are
/// <b>not</b> automatically recreated. They will only be recreated if one of the
/// 'compute' methods is invoked.
///
/// However, this is not always acceptable. Some clients need to keep the
/// analysis results up-to-date. For such clients there is a mechanism that
/// allows them to incrementally perform needed analysis and get notified of the
/// consequent changes to the analysis results. This mechanism is realized by the
/// method [performAnalysisTask].
///
/// Analysis engine allows for having more than one context. This can be used,
/// for example, to perform one analysis based on the state of files on disk and
/// a separate analysis based on the state of those files in open editors. It can
/// also be used to perform an analysis based on a proposed future state, such as
