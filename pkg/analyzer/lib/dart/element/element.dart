/// Defines the element model. The element model describes the semantic (as
/// opposed to syntactic) structure of Dart code. The syntactic structure of the
/// code is modeled by the [AST
/// structure](../dart_ast_ast/dart_ast_ast-library.html).
///
/// The element model consists of two closely related kinds of objects: elements
/// (instances of a subclass of [Element]) and types. This library defines the
/// elements, the types are defined in
/// [type.dart](../dart_element_type/dart_element_type-library.html).
///
/// Generally speaking, an element represents something that is declared in the
/// code, such as a class, method, or variable. Elements are organized in a tree
/// structure in which the children of an element are the elements that are
/// logically (and often syntactically) part of the declaration of the parent.
/// For example, the elements representing the methods and fields in a class are
/// children of the element representing the class.
///
/// Every complete element structure is rooted by an instance of the class
/// [LibraryElement]. A library element represents a single Dart library. Every
/// library is defined by one or more compilation units (the library and all of
/// its parts). The compilation units are represented by the class
/// [CompilationUnitElement] and are children of the library that is defined by
/// them. Each compilation unit can contain zero or more top-level declarations,
/// such as classes, functions, and variables. Each of these is in turn
/// represented as an element that is a child of the compilation unit. Classes
/// contain methods and fields, methods can contain local variables, etc.
///
/// The element model does not contain everything in the code, only those things
/// that are declared by the code. For example, it does not include any
/// representation of the statements in a method body, but if one of those
/// statements declares a local variable then the local variable will be
/// represented by an element.
