/**
 * Defines the element model. The element model describes the semantic (as
 * opposed to syntactic) structure of Dart code. The syntactic structure of the
 * code is modeled by the [AST structure](../ast/ast.dart).
 *
 * The element model consists of two closely related kinds of objects: elements
 * (instances of a subclass of [Element]) and types. This library defines the
 * elements, the types are defined in [type.dart](type.dart).
 *
 * Generally speaking, an element represents something that is declared in the
 * code, such as a class, method, or variable. Elements are organized in a tree
 * structure in which the children of an element are the elements that are
 * logically (and often syntactically) part of the declaration of the parent.
 * For example, the elements representing the methods and fields in a class are
 * children of the element representing the class.
 *
 * Every complete element structure is rooted by an instance of the class
 * [LibraryElement]. A library element represents a single Dart library. Every
 * library is defined by one or more compilation units (the library and all of
 * its parts). The compilation units are represented by the class
 * [CompilationUnitElement] and are children of the library that is defined by
 * them. Each compilation unit can contain zero or more top-level declarations,
 * such as classes, functions, and variables. Each of these is in turn
 * represented as an element that is a child of the compilation unit. Classes
 * contain methods and fields, methods can contain local variables, etc.
 *
 * The element model does not contain everything in the code, only those things
 * that are declared by the code. For example, it does not include any
 * representation of the statements in a method body, but if one of those
 * statements declares a local variable then the local variable will be
 * represented by an element.
