/// Defines the elements and fragments that are part of the element model.
///
/// The element model describes the semantic (as opposed to syntactic) structure
/// of Dart code. The syntactic structure of the code is modeled by the
/// [AST structure](../dart_ast_ast/dart_ast_ast-library.html).
///
/// The element model consists of three closely related kinds of objects:
/// elements (instances of a subclass of [Element2]), fragments (instances of a
/// subclass of [Fragment]) and types. This library defines the elements and
/// fragments; the types are defined in
/// [type.dart](../dart_element_type/dart_element_type-library.html).
///
/// Generally speaking, an element represents something that is declared in the
/// code, such as a class, method, or variable. Elements are organized in a tree
/// structure in which the children of an element are the elements that are
/// logically (and often syntactically) part of the declaration of the parent.
/// For example, the elements representing the methods and fields in a class are
/// children of the element representing the class.
///
/// Some elements, such as a [LocalVariableElement2] are declared by a single
/// declaration, but most elements can be declared by multiple declarations. A
/// fragment represents a single declararation when the corresponding element
/// can have multiple declarations. There is no fragment for an element that can
/// only have one declaration.
///
/// As with elements, fragments are organized in a tree structure. The two
/// structures parallel each other.
///
/// Every complete element structure is rooted by an instance of the class
/// [LibraryElement2]. A library element represents a single Dart library. Every
/// library is defined by one or more compilation units (the library and all of
/// its parts). The compilation units are represented by the class
/// [LibraryFragment].
///
/// The element model does not contain everything in the code, only those things
/// that are declared by the code. For example, it does not include any
/// representation of the statements in a method body, but if one of those
/// statements declares a local variable then the local variable will be
/// represented by an element.
