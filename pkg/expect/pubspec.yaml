description: >
 Expect is used for tests that do not want to make use of the
 Dart unit test library - for example, the core language tests.
 Third parties are discouraged from using this, and should use
 the expect() function in the unit test library instead for
 test assertions.

  sdk: ">=0.8.10+6 <2.0.0"
