const _desc = r'Prefer using a boolean as the assert condition.';

const _details = r'''
NOTE: This rule is removed in Dart 3.0.0; it is no longer functional.

**DO** use a boolean for assert conditions.

Not using booleans in assert conditions can lead to code where it isn't clear
what the intention of the assert statement is.

**BAD:**
```dart
assert(() {
  f();
  return true;
});
```

**GOOD:**
```dart
assert(() {
  f();
  return true;
}());
```
