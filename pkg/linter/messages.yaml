      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a method or function doesn't
      have an explicit return type.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the function `f`
      doesn't have a return type:

      ```dart
      [!f!]() {}
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Add an explicit return type:

      ```dart
      void f() {}
      ```
    deprecatedDetails: |-
      **DO** declare method return types.

      When declaring a method or function *always* specify a return type.
      Declaring return types for functions helps improve your codebase by allowing the
      analyzer to more adequately check your code for errors that could occur during
      runtime.

      **BAD:**

      main() { }

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the code being controlled by a
      control flow statement (`if`, `for`, `while`, or `do`) is on the same line
      as the control flow statement.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the `return` statement
      is on the same line as the `if` that controls whether the `return` will be
      executed:

      ```dart
      void f(bool b) {
        if (b) [!return!];
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Put the controlled statement onto a separate, indented, line:

      ```dart
      void f(bool b) {
        if (b)
          return;
      }
      ```
    deprecatedDetails: |-
      From the [style guide for the flutter repo](https://flutter.dev/style-guide/):

      **DO** separate the control structure expression from its statement.

      Don't put the statement part of an `if`, `for`, `while`, `do` on the same line
      as the expression, even if it is short.  Doing so makes it unclear that there
      is relevant code there.  This is especially important for early returns.

      **BAD:**
      ```dart
      if (notReady) return;

      if (notReady)
        return;
      else print('ok')

      while (condition) i += 1;
      ```

      **GOOD:**
      ```dart
      if (notReady)
        return;

      if (notReady)
        return;
      else
        print('ok')

      while (condition)
        i += 1;
      ```

      Note that this rule can conflict with the
      [Dart formatter](https://dart.dev/tools/dart-format), and should not be enabled
      when the Dart formatter is used.

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when required named parameters occur
      after optional named parameters.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the required parameter
      `x` is after the optional parameter `y`:

      ```dart
      void f({int? y, required int [!x!]}) {}
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Reorder the parameters so that all required named parameters are before
      any optional named parameters:

      ```dart
      void f({required int x, int? y}) {}
      ```
    deprecatedDetails: |-
      **DO** specify `required` on named parameter before other named parameters.

      **BAD:**

      **DO** specify `@required` on named parameters without a default value on which
      an `assert(param != null)` is done.

      **BAD:**
      ```dart
      m1({a}) {
        assert(a != null);
      }

  always_specify_types_add_type:

    problemMessage: "Missing type annotation."
    correctionMessage: "Try adding a type annotation."
    state:
      stable: "2.0"
    categories: [style]
    hasPublishedDocs: false
    deprecatedDetails: |-
      From the [style guide for the flutter repo](https://flutter.dev/style-guide/):

      **DO** specify type annotations.

      Avoid `var` when specifying that a type is unknown and short-hands that elide
      type annotations.  Use `dynamic` if you are being explicit that the type is
      unknown.  Use `Object` if you are being explicit that you want an object that
      implements `==` and `hashCode`.

      **BAD:**
      ```dart
      var foo = 10;
      final bar = Bar();
      const quux = 20;
      ```

      **GOOD:**
      ```dart
      int foo = 10;
      final Bar bar = Bar();
      String baz = 'hello';
      const int quux = 20;
      ```

      NOTE: Using the the `@optionalTypeArgs` annotation in the `meta` package, API
      authors can special-case type parameters whose type needs to be dynamic but whose
      declaration should be treated as optional.  For example, suppose you have a
      `Key` object whose type parameter you'd like to treat as optional.  Using the
      `@optionalTypeArgs` would look like this:

      ```dart
      import 'package:meta/meta.dart';

      @optionalTypeArgs
      class Key<T> {
       ...
      }

    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an `import` in a library inside
      the `lib` directory uses a relative path to import another library inside
      the `lib` directory of the same package.

      #### Example

      Given that a file named `a.dart` and the code below are both inside the
      `lib` directory of the same package, the following code produces this
      diagnostic because a relative URI is used to import `a.dart`:

      ```dart
      import [!'a.dart'!];
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Use a package import:

      ```dart
      import 'package:p/a.dart';
      ```
    deprecatedDetails: |-
      **DO** avoid relative imports for files in `lib/`.

      When mixing relative and absolute imports it's possible to create confusion
      where the same member gets imported in two different ways. One way to avoid
      that is to ensure you consistently use absolute imports for files within the
      `lib/` directory.

      This is the opposite of 'prefer_relative_imports'.

      You can also use 'avoid_relative_lib_imports' to disallow relative imports of
      files within `lib/` directory outside of it (for example `test/`).

      **BAD:**
      ```dart
      import 'baz.dart';

      import 'src/bag.dart'

      import '../lib/baz.dart';

    categories: [style]
    hasPublishedDocs: true
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a member overrides an inherited
      member, but isn't annotated with `@override`.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the method `m` in the
      class `B` overrides the method with the same name in class `A`, but isn't
      marked as an intentional override:

      ```dart
      class A {
        void m() {}
      }

      class B extends A {
        void [!m!]() {}
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If the member in the subclass is intended to override the member in the
      superclass, then add an `@override` annotation:

      ```dart
      class A {
        void m() {}
      }

      class B extends A {
        @override
        void m() {}
      }
      ```

      If the member in the subclass is not intended to override the member in
      the superclass, then rename one of the members:

      ```dart
      class A {
        void m() {}
      }

      class B extends A {
        void m2() {}
      }
      ```

      **AVOID** using `as`.

      If you know the type is correct, use an assertion or assign to a more

      From [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/effective-dart/usage#avoid-catches-without-on-clauses):

      **AVOID** catches without on clauses.

      Using catch clauses without on clauses make your code prone to encountering
      unexpected errors that won't be thrown (and thus will go unnoticed).

      **BAD:**
      ```dart
      try {
       somethingRisky()
      } catch(e) {
        doSomething(e);

       somethingRisky()
      } on Exception catch(e) {
        doSomething(e);
      }
      ```

      A few exceptional cases are allowed:

      * If the body of the catch rethrows the exception.
      * If the caught exception is "directly used" in an argument to `Future.error`,
        `Completer.completeError`, or `FlutterError.reportError`, or any function with
        a return type of `Never`.
      * If the caught exception is "directly used" in a new throw-expression.

      In these cases, "directly used" means that the exception is referenced within
      the relevant code (like within an argument). If the exception variable is
      referenced _before_ the relevant code, for example to instantiate a wrapper
      exception, the variable is not "directly used."

      **AVOID** to check if type is `double` or `int`.

      When compiled to JS, integer values are represented as floats. That can lead to
      some unexpected behavior when using either `is` or `is!` where the type is
      either `int` or `double`.

      **DO** avoid method calls or accessing properties on an object that is either
      explicitly or implicitly statically typed `dynamic`. Dynamic calls are treated
      slightly different in every runtime environment and compiler, but most
      production modes (and even some development modes) have both compile size and
      runtime performance penalties associated with dynamic calls.

      Additionally, targets typed `dynamic` disables most static analysis, meaning it
      is easier to lead to a runtime `NoSuchMethodError` or `TypeError` than properly
      statically typed Dart code.

      There is an exception to methods and properties that exist on `Object?`:
      - `a.hashCode`
      - `a.runtimeType`
      - `a.noSuchMethod(someInvocation)`
      - `a.toString()`

      ... these members are dynamically dispatched in the web-based runtimes, but not
      in the VM-based ones. Additionally, they are so common that it would be very
      punishing to disallow `any.toString()` or `any == true`, for example.

      Note that despite `Function` being a type, the semantics are close to identical
      to `dynamic`, and calls to an object that is typed `Function` will also trigger
      this lint.

      Dynamic calls are allowed on cast expressions (`as dynamic` or `as Function`).

      **BAD:**

      void explicitDynamicType(dynamic object) {

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the statement after an `else`
      is an empty statement (a semicolon).

      For more information, see the documentation for
      [`avoid_empty_else`](https://dart.dev/diagnostics/avoid_empty_else).

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the statement
      following the `else` is an empty statement:

      ```dart
      void f(int x, int y) {
        if (x > y)
          print("1");
        else [!;!]
          print("2");
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If the statement after the empty statement is intended to be executed only
      when the condition is `false`, then remove the empty statement:

      ```dart
      void f(int x, int y) {
        if (x > y)
          print("1");
        else
          print("2");
      }
      ```

      If there is no code that is intended to be executed only when the
      condition is `false`, then remove the whole `else` clause:

      ```dart
      void f(int x, int y) {
        if (x > y)
          print("1");
        print("2");
      }

      else ;
        print('2');
      ```

      If you want a statement that follows the empty clause to _conditionally_ run,
      remove the dangling semicolon to include it in the `else` clause.
      Optionally, also enclose the else's statement in a block.

      **GOOD:**
      ```dart
      if (x > y)
        print('1');
      else

      } else {

      If you want a statement that follows the empty clause to _unconditionally_ run,
      remove the `else` clause.

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the type `FutureOr<void>`
      is used as the type of a result (to be precise: it is used in a
      position that isn't contravariant). The type `FutureOr<void>` is
      problematic because it may appear to encode that a result is either a
      `Future<void>`, or the result should be discarded (when it is
      `void`).  However, there is no safe way to detect whether we have one
      or the other case because an expression of type `void` can evaluate
      to any object whatsoever, including a future of any type.

      It is also conceptually unsound to have a type whose meaning is
      something like "ignore this object; also, take a look because it
      might be a future".

      An exception is made for contravariant occurrences of the type
      `FutureOr<void>` (e.g., for the type of a formal parameter), and no
      warning is emitted for these occurrences. The reason for this
      exception is that the type does not describe a result, it describes a
      constraint on a value provided by others. Similarly, an exception is
      made for type alias declarations, because they may well be used in a
      contravariant position (e.g., as the type of a formal
      parameter). Hence, in type alias declarations, only the type
      parameter bounds are checked.

      #### Example

      ```dart
      import 'dart:async';

      [!FutureOr<void>!] m() => null;
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      A replacement for the type `FutureOr<void>` which is often useful is
      `Future<void>?`. This type encodes that a result is either a
      `Future<void>` or it is null, and there is no ambiguity at run time
      since no object can have both types.

      It may not always be possible to use the type `Future<void>?` as a
      replacement for the type `FutureOr<void>`, because the latter is a
      supertype of all types, and the former is not. In this case it may be a
      useful remedy to replace `FutureOr<void>` by the type `void`.

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a nullable variable is
      explicitly initialized to `null`. The variable can be a local variable,
      field, or top-level variable.

      A variable or field that isn't explicitly initialized automatically gets
      initialized to `null`. There's no concept of "uninitialized memory" in
      Dart.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the variable `f` is
      explicitly initialized to `null`:

      ```dart
      class C {
        int? [!f = null!];

      If a variable has a non-nullable type or is `final`,
      Dart reports a compile error if you try to use it
      before it has been definitely initialized.
      If the variable is nullable and not `const` or `final`,
      then it is implicitly initialized to `null` for you.
      There's no concept of "uninitialized memory" in Dart
      and no need to explicitly initialize a variable to `null` to be "safe".
      Adding `= null` is redundant and unneeded.

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the function `print` is invoked
      in production code.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the function `print`
      can't be invoked in production:

      ```dart
      void f(int x) {
        [!print!]('x = $x');
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If you're writing code that uses Flutter, then use the function
      [`debugPrint`][debugPrint], guarded by a test
      using [`kDebugMode`][kDebugMode]:

      ```dart
      import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';

        if (kDebugMode) {
          debugPrint('x = $x');
        }
      }
      ```

      If you're writing code that doesn't use Flutter, then use a logging
      service, such as [`package:logging`][package-logging], to write the
      information.
    deprecatedDetails: |-

      example, two classes, `A` and `B` where `B` is a subclass of `A`, and `B`
      overrides a method declared on `A`, and that method has a parameter with one
      default value in `A`'s declaration, and a different default value in `B`'s

      `B`'s default value matches the argument, then the argument can be omitted (and
      if the argument value is different, then a lint is not reported). If, however,
      the static type of the target of the invoked method is `A`, then a lint may be
      reported, but we cannot know statically which method is invoked, so the reported

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an asynchronous file I/O method
      with a synchronous equivalent is used.

      The following are the specific flagged asynchronous methods:

      - `Directory.exists`
      - `Directory.stat`
      - `File.lastModified`
      - `File.exists`
      - `File.stat`
      - `FileSystemEntity.isDirectory`
      - `FileSystemEntity.isFile`
      - `FileSystemEntity.isLink`
      - `FileSystemEntity.type`

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the async method
      `exists` is invoked:

      ```dart
      import 'dart:io';

      Future<void> g(File f) async {
        await [!f.exists()!];
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Use the synchronous version of the method:

      ```dart
      import 'dart:io';

      void g(File f) {
        f.existsSync();
      }
      ```

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the method `toString` is
      invoked on a value whose static type is `Type`.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the method `toString`
      is invoked on the `Type` returned by `runtimeType`:

      ```dart
      bool isC(Object o) => o.runtimeType.[!toString!]() == 'C';

      class C {}
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If it's essential that the type is exactly the same, then use an explicit
      comparison:

      ```dart
      bool isC(Object o) => o.runtimeType == C;

      class C {}
      ```

      If it's alright for instances of subtypes of the type to return `true`,
      then use a type check:

      ```dart
      bool isC(Object o) => o is C;

      class C {}
      ```
    deprecatedDetails: |-
      **DO** avoid calls to <Type>.toString() in production code, since it does not
      contractually return the user-defined name of the Type (or underlying class).
      Development-mode compilers where code size is not a concern use the full name,
      but release-mode compilers often choose to minify these symbols.

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the name of a parameter in a
      parameter list is the same as a visible type (a type whose name is in
      scope).

      This often indicates that the intended name of the parameter is missing,
      causing the name of the type to be used as the name of the parameter
      rather than the type of the parameter. Even when that's not the case (the
      name of the parameter is intentional), the name of the parameter will
      shadow the existing type, which can lead to bugs that are difficult to
      diagnose.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the function `f` has a
      parameter named `int`, which shadows the type `int` from `dart:core`:

      ```dart
      void f([!int!]) {}
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If the parameter name is missing, then add a name for the parameter:

      ```dart
      void f(int x) {}
      ```

      If the parameter is intended to have an implicit type of `dynamic`, then
      rename the parameter so that it doesn't shadow the name of any visible type:

      ```dart

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a widget tree contains an
      instance of `Container` and the only argument to the constructor is
      `child:`.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the invocation of the
      `Container` constructor only has a `child:` argument:

      ```dart
      import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

      Widget buildRow() {
        return [!Container!](
          child: Row(
            children: [
              Text('a'),
              Text('b'),
            ],
          )
        );
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If you intended to provide other arguments to the constructor, then add
      them:

      ```dart
      import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

      Widget buildRow() {
        return Container(
          color: Colors.red.shade100,

            ],
          )
        );
      }
      ```

      If no other arguments are needed, then unwrap the child widget:

      ```dart
      import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

      Widget buildRow() {
        return Row(
          children: [

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an instance of `Sink` is
      created but the method `close` isn't invoked.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the `sink` isn't

      void g(File f) {
        var [!sink = f.openWrite()!];
        sink.write('x');

      ```dart
      import 'dart:io';

      void g(File f) {
        var sink = f.openWrite();

    state:
      stable: "2.19"
    categories: [unintentional]
    hasPublishedDocs: true
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when any one of several methods in
      the core libraries are invoked with arguments of an inappropriate type.
      These methods are ones that don't provide a specific enough type for the
      parameter to allow the normal type checking to catch the error.

      The arguments that are checked are:
      - an argument to `Iterable<E>.contains` should be related to `E`
      - an argument to `List<E>.remove` should be related to `E`
      - an argument to `Map<K, V>.containsKey` should be related to `K`
      - an argument to `Map<K, V>.containsValue` should be related to `V`
      - an argument to `Map<K, V>.remove` should be related to `K`
      - an argument to `Map<K, V>.[]` should be related to `K`
      - an argument to `Queue<E>.remove` should be related to `E`
      - an argument to `Set<E>.lookup` should be related to `E`
      - an argument to `Set<E>.remove` should be related to `E`

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the argument to
      `contains` is a `String`, which isn't assignable to `int`, the element
      type of the list `l`:

      ```dart
      bool f(List<int> l)  => l.contains([!'1'!]);
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If the element type is correct, then change the argument to have the same
      type:

      ```dart
      bool f(List<int> l)  => l.contains(1);
      ```

      If the argument type is correct, then change the element type:

      ```dart
      bool f(List<String> l)  => l.contains('1');

      An argument passed to a collection method should relate to the collection type
      as follows:

      * an argument to `Iterable<E>.contains` should be related to `E`
      * an argument to `List<E>.remove` should be related to `E`
      * an argument to `Map<K, V>.containsKey` should be related to `K`
      * an argument to `Map<K, V>.containsValue` should be related to `V`
      * an argument to `Map<K, V>.remove` should be related to `K`
      * an argument to `Map<K, V>.[]` should be related to `K`
      * an argument to `Queue<E>.remove` should be related to `E`
      * an argument to `Set<E>.lookup` should be related to `E`
      * an argument to `Set<E>.remove` should be related to `E`

      **DO** reference only in-scope identifiers in doc comments.

      If you surround identifiers like variable, method, or type names in square
      brackets, then tools like your IDE and
      [`dart doc`](https://dart.dev/tools/dart-doc) can link to them. For this to
      work, ensure that all identifiers in docs wrapped in brackets are in scope.

      For example, assuming `outOfScopeId` is out of scope:

      **BAD:**
      ```dart
      /// Returns whether [value] is larger than [outOfScopeId].
      bool isOutOfRange(int value) { ... }
      ```

      **GOOD:**
      ```dart
      /// Returns the larger of [a] or [b].
      int max_int(int a, int b) { ... }
      ```

      Note that the square bracket comment format is designed to allow comments to
      refer to declarations using a fairly natural format but does not allow
      *arbitrary expressions*.  In particular, code references within square brackets
      can consist of any of the following:

      - A bare identifier which is in-scope for the comment (see the spec for what is
        "in-scope" in doc comments). Examples include `[print]` and `[Future]`.
      - Two identifiers separated by a period (a "prefixed identifier"), such that the
        first identifier acts as a namespacing identifier, such as a class property
        name or method name prefixed by the containing class's name, or a top-level
        identifier prefixed by an import prefix. Examples include `[Future.new]` (an
        unnamed constructor), `[Future.value]` (a constructor), `[Future.wait]` (a
        static method), `[Future.then]` (an instance method), `[math.max]` (given that
        'dart:async' is imported with a `max` prefix).
      - A prefixed identifier followed by a pair of parentheses, used to disambiguate
        named constructors from instance members (whose names are allowed to collide).
        Examples include `[Future.value()]`.
      - Three identifiers separated by two periods, such that the first identifier is
        an import prefix name, the second identifier is a top-level element like a
        class or an extension, and the third identifier is a member of that top-level
        element. Examples include `[async.Future.then]` (given that 'dart:async' is
        imported with an `async` prefix).

      **Known limitations**

      The `comment_references` lint rule aligns with the Dart analyzer's notion of
      comment references, which is occasionally distinct from Dartdoc's notion of
      comment references. The lint rule may report comment references which Dartdoc
      can resolve, even though the analyzer cannot. See

      #### Common fixes

      If the statement isn't needed, then remove the statement, and remove the

      separated from the declaration by one or more blank lines.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because there's a
      documentation comment before the first `import` directive:

      ```dart
      [!/// This is a great library.!]
      import 'dart:core';
      ```

      The following code produces this diagnostic because there's a
      documentation comment before the first class declaration, but there's a
      blank line between the comment and the declaration.

      ```dart
      [!/// This is a great library.!]

      class C {}
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If the comment is library documentation, then add a `library` directive
      without a name:

      ```dart
      /// This is a great library.
      library;

      import 'dart:core';
      ```

      If the comment is documentation for the following declaration, then remove
      the blank line:

      ```dart
      /// This is a great library.
      class C {}
      ```
    deprecatedDetails: |-
      Attach library doc comments (with `///`) to library directives, rather than
      leaving them dangling near the top of a library.

      **BAD:**
      ```dart
      /// This is a great library.
      import 'package:math';
      ```

      ```dart
      /// This is a great library.

      class C {}
      ```

      **GOOD:**
      ```dart
      /// This is a great library.
      library;

      import 'package:math';

      class C {}
      ```

      **NOTE:** An unnamed library, like `library;` above, is only supported in Dart
      2.19 and later. Code which might run in earlier versions of Dart will need to
      provide a name in the `library` directive.

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a package import refers to a
      package that is not specified in the `pubspec.yaml` file.

      Depending explicitly on packages that you reference ensures they will
      always exist and allows you to put a dependency constraint on them to
      guard against breaking changes.

      #### Example

      Given a `pubspec.yaml` file containing the following:

      ```yaml
      dependencies:
        meta: ^3.0.0
      ```

      The following code produces this diagnostic because there is no dependency
      on the package `a`:

      ```dart
      import 'package:a/a.dart';
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Whether the dependency should be a regular dependency or dev dependency
      depends on whether the package is referenced from a public library (one
      under either `lib` or `bin`), or only private libraries, (such as one
      under `test`).

      If the package is referenced from at least one public library, then add a
      regular dependency on the package to the `pubspec.yaml` file under the
      `dependencies` field:

      ```yaml
      dependencies:
        a: ^1.0.0
        meta: ^3.0.0
      ```

      If the package is referenced only from private libraries, then add a
      dev dependency on the package to the `pubspec.yaml` file under the
      `dev_dependencies` field:

      ```yaml
      dependencies:
        meta: ^3.0.0
      dev_dependencies:
        a: ^1.0.0
      ```
    deprecatedDetails: |-
      **DO** depend on referenced packages.

      When importing a package, add a dependency on it to your pubspec.

      Depending explicitly on packages that you reference ensures they will always
      exist and allows you to put a dependency constraint on them to guard you
      against breaking changes.

      Whether this should be a regular dependency or dev_dependency depends on if it
      is referenced from a public file (one under either `lib` or `bin`), or some
      other private file.

      **BAD:**

      Implementers of `Diagnosticable` should reference all public properties in
      a `debugFillProperties(...)` or `debugDescribeChildren(...)` method
      implementation to improve debuggability at runtime.

      Public properties are defined as fields and getters that are

      * not package-private (e.g., prefixed with `_`)
      * not `static` or overriding
      * not themselves `Widget`s or collections of `Widget`s

      In addition, the "debug" prefix is treated specially for properties in Flutter.
      For the purposes of diagnostics, a property `foo` and a prefixed property
      `debugFoo` are treated as effectively describing the same property and it is
      sufficient to refer to one or the other.

      void g() {}

      If there are no statements that need to be controlled but the control
      structure is still required for other reasons, then replace the empty
      statement with a block to make the structure of the code more obvious:

      ```dart
      void f(bool condition) {
        while (condition) {}
        g();
      }

      void g() {}
      ```

      If there are statements that need to be controlled, remove the empty
      statement and adjust the code so that the appropriate statements are being
      controlled, possibly adding a block:

      ```dart
      void f(bool condition) {
        while (condition) {
          g();
        }
      }

      void g() {}

      doesn't use lower_case_with_underscores.

      #### Example

      A file named `SliderMenu.dart` produces this diagnostic because the file
      name uses the UpperCamelCase convention.

      #### Common fixes

      Rename the file to use the lower_case_with_underscores convention, such as
      `slider_menu.dart`.

      **DO** name source files using `lowercase_with_underscores`.

      Some file systems are not case-sensitive, so many projects require filenames to
      be all lowercase. Using a separating character allows names to still be readable
      in that form. Using underscores as the separator ensures that the name is still
      a valid Dart identifier, which may be helpful if the language later supports
      symbolic imports.

      **BAD:**

      * `SliderMenu.dart`
      * `filesystem.dart`
      * `file-system.dart`

      **GOOD:**

      * `slider_menu.dart`

      Files without a strict `.dart` extension are ignored.  For example:

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a class or mixin either
      overrides the definition of `==` but doesn't override the definition of
      `hashCode`, or conversely overrides the definition of `hashCode` but
      doesn't override the definition of `==`.

      Both the `==` operator and the `hashCode` property of objects must be
      consistent for a common hash map implementation to function properly. As a
      result, when overriding either method, both should be overridden.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the class `C`
      overrides the `==` operator but doesn't override the getter `hashCode`:

      ```dart
      class C {
        final int value;

        C(this.value);

        @override
        bool operator [!==!](Object other) =>
            other is C &&
            other.runtimeType == runtimeType &&
            other.value == value;
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If you need to override one of the members, then add an override of the
      other:

      ```dart
      class C {
        final int value;

        C(this.value);

        @override
        bool operator ==(Object other) =>
            other is C &&
            other.runtimeType == runtimeType &&
            other.value == value;

        @override
        int get hashCode => value.hashCode;
      }
      ```

      If you don't need to override either of the members, then remove the
      unnecessary override:

      ```dart
      class C {
        final int value;

        C(this.value);
      }
      ```
    deprecatedDetails: |-
      **DO** override `hashCode` if overriding `==` and prefer overriding `==` if
      overriding `hashCode`.

      Every object in Dart has a `hashCode`.  Both the `==` operator and the
      `hashCode` property of objects must be consistent in order for a common hash
      map implementation to function properly.  Thus, when overriding `==`, the
      `hashCode` should also be overridden to maintain consistency. Similarly, if
      `hashCode` is overridden, `==` should be also.

      **BAD:**
      ```dart
      class Bad {
        final int value;
        Bad(this.value);

        @override
        bool operator ==(Object other) => other is Bad && other.value == value;
      }
      ```

      **GOOD:**
      ```dart
      class Better {
        final int value;
        Better(this.value);

        @override
        bool operator ==(Object other) =>
            other is Better &&
            other.runtimeType == runtimeType &&
            other.value == value;

      violates [the convention for pub
      packages](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/package-layout#implementation-files).

      #### Example

      The following code, assuming that it isn't part of the `ffi` package,
      produces this diagnostic because the library being imported is inside the
      top-level `src` directory:

      ```dart
      import [!'package:ffi/src/allocation.dart'!];

      #### Common fixes

      If the library being imported contains code that's part of the public API,
      then import the public library that exports the public API:

      ```dart
      import 'package:ffi/ffi.dart';
      ```

      If the library being imported isn't part of the public API of the package,
      then either find a different way to accomplish your goal, assuming that
      it's possible, or open an issue asking the package authors to make it part
      of the public API.

      The libraries inside `lib` are publicly visible: other packages are free to
      import them.  But much of a package's code is internal implementation libraries
      that should only be imported and used by the package itself.  Those go inside a
      subdirectory of `lib` called `src`.  You can create subdirectories in there if
      it helps you organize things.

      You are free to import libraries that live in `lib/src` from within other Dart
      code in the same package (like other libraries in `lib`, scripts in `bin`,
      and tests) but you should never import from another package's `lib/src`

      Using an `interface`, `base`, `final`, or `sealed` modifier on a class,

      In some cases, it's possible for an author to inadvertently relax these controls
      and implicitly "reopen" a class. (A similar reopening cannot occur with a mixin.)

      Some case expressions that are valid in Dart 2.19 and below will become an error
      or have changed semantics when a library is upgraded to 3.0. This lint flags
      those expressions in order to ease migration to Dart 3.0.

      Some valid switch cases in 2.19 will become compile errors in Dart 3.0:

      * Set literals
      * Parenthesized expressions
      * Calls to `identical()`.
      * Unary operator expressions `!`, `-`, or `~` (except for `-` before an integer
        literal, which is a valid pattern and is fine)
      * Binary operator expressions `!=`, `==`, `&`, `|`, `^`, `~/`, `>>`, `>>>`,
        `<<`, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `??`.
      * Conditional operator `?:`
      * `.length` calls on strings
      * `is` and `is!` expressions

      Examples of all of them:

      ```dart
      switch (obj) {
        case {1}: // Set literal.
        case (1): // Parenthesized expression.
        case identical(1, 2): // `identical()` call.
        case -pi: // Unary operator.
        case 1 + 2: // Binary operator.
        case true ? 1 : 2: // Conditional operator.
        case 'hi'.length: // .length call.
        case i is int: // is expression.
      }
      ```

      Some valid switch cases in 2.19 are also syntactically valid patterns, but the
      pattern matching behavior may be different from the current constant equality
      behavior. They are:

      **List and map literals.** A list or map literal can appear as a constant in a
      case:

      ```dart
      switch (obj) {
        case [1, 2]: ...
        case {'k': 'v'}: ...
      }
      ```

      Currently, the case will only match if the incoming value has the same identity
      as the constant. So:

      ```dart
      test(List<int> list) {
        switch (list) {
          case [1, 2]: print('Matched'); break;
          default: print('Did not match'); break;
        }
      }

      main() {
        test(const [1, 2]); // Prints "Matched".
        test([1, 2]); // Prints "Did not match".
      }
      ```

      With patterns, a list or map literal becomes a list or map pattern. The pattern
      destructures the incoming object and matches if the subpatterns all match. In
      other words, list and map pattern match using something more like deep equality.

      With Dart 3.0, the above program prints "Matched" twice.

      **Constant constructor calls.** Similar to collections, you can construct a
      constant instance of a class in a case:

      ```dart
      class Point {
        final int x;
        final int y;
        const Point({this.x, this.y});
      }

      test(Point p) {
        switch (p) {
          case Point(x: 1, y: 2): print('Matched'); break;
          default: print('Did not match'); break;
        }
      }

      main() {
        test(const Point(1, 2)); // Prints "Matched".
        test(Point(1, 2)); // Prints "Did not match".
      }
      ```

      Again, like collections, the case currently only matches if the incoming value
      has the same identity. With patterns, the `Point(...)` syntax becomes an object
      pattern that destructures the incoming point, calls the `x` and `y` getters on
      it and then matches the results of those against the corresponding subpatterns.

      In this example, it will print "Matched" twice.

      Note that object patterns only support named fields. So any constant constructor
      in a case today that has positional arguments will become a compile-time error
      when parsed as a pattern. A constant constructor call with no arguments is a
      valid object pattern and only does a type test:

      ```dart
      class Thing {
        const Thing();
      }

      test(Thing t) {
        switch (t) {
          case Thing(): print('Matched'); break;
          default: print('Did not match'); break;
        }
      }

      main() {
        test(const Thing()); // Prints "Matched".
        test(Thing()); // Prints "Did not match".
      }
      ```

      When interpreted as a pattern, this prints "Matched" twice.

      **Wildcards.** Today, you can have a constant named `_`:

      ```dart
      test(int n) {
        const _ = 3;
        switch (n) {
          case _: print('Matched'); break;
          default: print('Did not match'); break;
        }
      }

      main() {
        test(3); // Prints "Matched".
        test(5); // Prints "Did not match".
      }
      ```

      With patterns, the identifier `_` is treated as a pattern that matches all
      values, so this prints "Matched" twice.

      **Logic operators.** The logic operators `&&` and `||` are valid constant
      expressions and also valid patterns. As a constant expression, they simply
      evaluate the expression to a boolean and match if the incoming value is equal to
      that boolean value. So:

      ```dart
      test(bool b) {
        switch (b) {
          case true && false: print('Matched'); break;
          default: print('Did not match'); break;
        }
      }

      main() {
        test(false); // Prints "Matched".
        test(true); // Prints "Did not match".
      }
      ```

      With Dart 3.0, these become patterns. The above example prints "Did not match"
      twice because no boolean value can be both true and false.

      Many of invalid cases can be mechanically changed to something that is valid
      both in Dart today and valid and means the same in Dart 3.0.

      **Parenthesized expressions:** Provided the inner expression is one that's not
      broken in Dart 3.0, just discard the parentheses.

      **List literals, map literals, set literals, and constant constructor calls:**
      Put `const` before the literal or call. This turns it into a constant pattern
      which preserves the current behavior:

      **BAD:**

      ```dart
      case [1, 2]:
      case {'k': 'v'}:
      case {1, 2}:
      case Point(1, 2):
      ```

      **GOOD:**

      ```dart
      case const [1, 2]:
      case const {'k': 'v'}:
      case const {1, 2}:
      case const Point(1, 2):
      ```

      * **Wildcards:** Rename the constant from `_` to something else. Since the name
      is private, this can be done locally in the library without affecting other
      code.

      * **Everything else:** For any other invalid expression, you have to hoist the
      expression out into a new named constant. For example, if you have code like
      this:


      **BAD:**

      ```dart
      switch (n) {
        case 1 + 2: ...
      }
      ```

      It can be fixed by changing it to:

      **GOOD:**

       ```dart
      const three = 1 + 2;

      switch (n) {
        case three: ...

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an `is` test has either:
      - a JS interop type on the right-hand side, whether directly or as a type
        argument to another type, or
      - a JS interop value on the left-hand side.

      #### Examples

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the JS interop type
      `JSBoolean` is on the right-hand side of an `is` test:

      ```dart
      import 'dart:js_interop';

      bool f(Object b) => [!b is JSBoolean!];
      ```

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the JS interop type
      `JSString` is used as a type argument on the right-hand side of an `is`
      test:

      ```dart
      import 'dart:js_interop';

      bool f(List<Object> l) => [!l is List<JSString>!];
      ```

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the JS interop value
      `a` is on the left-hand side of an `is` test:

      ```dart
      import 'dart:js_interop';

      bool f(JSAny a) => [!a is String!];
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Use a JS interop helper, such as `isA`, to check the underlying type of
      JS interop values:

      ```dart
      import 'dart:js_interop';

      void f(Object b) => b.jsify()?.isA<JSBoolean>();
      ```
    deprecatedDetails: |-
      **DON'T** use `is` checks where the type is a JS interop type.

      **DON'T** use `is` checks where the type is a generic Dart type that has JS
      interop type arguments.

      **DON'T** use `is` checks with a JS interop value.

      `dart:js_interop` types have runtime types that are different based on whether
      you are compiling to JS or to Wasm. Therefore, runtime type checks may result in
      different behavior. Runtime checks also do not necessarily check that a JS
      interop value is a particular JavaScript type.

      **BAD:**
      ```dart
      extension type HTMLElement(JSObject o) {}
      extension type HTMLDivElement(JSObject o) implements HTMLElement {}

      void compute(JSAny a, bool b, List<JSObject> lo, List<String> ls, JSObject o,
          HTMLElement e) {
        a is String; // LINT, checking that a JS value is a Dart type
        b is JSBoolean; // LINT, checking that a Dart value is a JS type
        a is JSString; // LINT, checking that a JS value is a different JS interop
                       // type
        o is JSNumber; // LINT, checking that a JS value is a different JS interop
                       // type
        lo is List<String>; // LINT, JS interop type argument and Dart type argument
                            // are incompatible
        ls is List<JSString>; // LINT, Dart type argument and JS interop type argument
                              // are incompatible
        lo is List<JSArray>; // LINT, comparing JS interop type argument with
                             // different JS interop type argument
        lo is List<JSNumber>; // LINT, comparing JS interop type argument with
                              // different JS interop type argument
        o is HTMLElement; // LINT, true because both are JSObjects but doesn't check
                          // that it's a JS HTMLElement
        e is HTMLDivElement; // LINT, true because both are JSObjects but doesn't
                             // check that it's a JS HTMLDivElement
      }
      ```

      Prefer using JS interop helpers like `isA` from `dart:js_interop` to check the
      underlying type of JS interop values.

      **GOOD:**
      ```dart
      extension type HTMLElement(JSObject o) implements JSObject {}
      extension type HTMLDivElement(JSObject o) implements HTMLElement {}

      void compute(JSAny a, List<JSAny> l, JSObject o, HTMLElement e) {
        a.isA<JSString>; // OK, uses JS interop to check it is a JS string
        l[0].isA<JSString>; // OK, uses JS interop to check it is a JS string
        o.isA<HTMLElement>(); // OK, uses JS interop to check `o` is an HTMLElement
        e.isA<HTMLDivElement>(); // OK, uses JS interop to check `e` is an
                                 // HTMLDivElement
      }
      ```

      **DON'T** use `as` to cast a JS interop value to an unrelated Dart type or an
      unrelated Dart value to a JS interop type.

      **DON'T** use `as` to cast a JS interop value to a JS interop type represented
      by an incompatible `dart:js_interop` type.

      **BAD:**

      extension type Window(JSObject o) {}

      void compute(String s, JSBoolean b, Window w, List<String> l,
          List<JSObject> lo) {
        s as JSString; // LINT, casting Dart type to JS interop type
        b as bool; // LINT, casting JS interop type to Dart type
        b as JSNumber; // LINT, JSBoolean and JSNumber are incompatible
        b as Window; // LINT, JSBoolean and JSObject are incompatible
        w as JSBoolean; // LINT, JSObject and JSBoolean are incompatible
        l as List<JSString>; // LINT, casting Dart value with Dart type argument to
                             // Dart type with JS interop type argument
        lo as List<String>; // LINT, casting Dart value with JS interop type argument
                            // to Dart type with Dart type argument
        lo as List<JSBoolean>; // LINT, casting Dart value with JS interop type
                               // argument to Dart type with incompatible JS interop
                               // type argument
      }
      ```

      Prefer using `dart:js_interop` conversion methods to convert a JS interop value
      to a Dart value and vice versa.

      **GOOD:**
      ```dart
      extension type Window(JSObject o) {}
      extension type Document(JSObject o) {}

        a.toDart; // OK, converts the JS type to a Dart type
        w as Document; // OK, but no runtime check that `w` is a JS Document
        ls.map((e) => e.toJS).toList(); // OK, converts the Dart types to JS types
        o as JSArray<JSString>; // OK, JSObject and JSArray are compatible
        la as List<JSString>; // OK, JSAny and JSString are compatible
        (o as Object) as JSObject; // OK, Object is a supertype of JSAny

      NOTE: This rule is removed in Dart 3.0.0; it is no longer functional.

      **DON'T** test for conditions that can be inferred at compile time or test the
      same condition twice.

      Conditional statements using a condition which cannot be anything but `false`
      have the effect of making blocks of code non-functional.  If the condition
      cannot evaluate to anything but `true`, the conditional statement is completely
      redundant, and makes the code less readable.
      It is quite likely that the code does not match the programmer's intent.
      Either the condition should be removed or it should be updated so that it does
      not always evaluate to `true` or `false` and does not perform redundant tests.
      This rule will hint to the test conflicting with the linted one.

      `libraryName` isn't a lower_case_with_underscores identifier:

      #### Common fixes

      If the library name is not required, then remove the library name:

      ```dart

      If the library name is required, then convert it to use the

      **DO** name libraries using `lowercase_with_underscores`.

      Some file systems are not case-sensitive, so many projects require filenames to
      be all lowercase. Using a separating character allows names to still be readable
      in that form. Using underscores as the separator ensures that the name is still
      a valid Dart identifier, which may be helpful if the language later supports
      symbolic imports.

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a type that is not part of the
      public API of a library is referenced in the public API of that library.

      Using a private type in a public API can make the API unusable outside the
      defining library.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the parameter `c` of
      the public function `f` has a type that is library private (`_C`):

      ```dart
      void f([!_C!] c) {}

      class _C {}
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If the API doesn't need to be used outside the defining library, then make
      it private:

      ```dart
      void _f(_C c) {}

      class _C {}
      ```

      If the API needs to be part of the public API of the library, then either
      use a different type that's public, or make the referenced type public:

      ```dart
      void f(C c) {}

      class C {}

      For the purposes of this lint, a public API is considered to be any top-level or
      member declaration unless the declaration is library private or contained in a
      declaration that's library private. The following uses of types are checked:

      - the return type of a function or method,
      - the type of any parameter of a function or method,
      - the bound of a type parameter to any function, method, class, mixin,
        extension's extended type, or type alias,
      - the type of any top level variable or field,
      - any type used in the declaration of a type alias (for example
        `typedef F = _Private Function();`), or
      - any type used in the `on` clause of an extension or a mixin

      **AVOID** lines longer than 80 characters

      Readability studies show that long lines of text are harder to read because your
      eye has to travel farther when moving to the beginning of the next line. This is
      why newspapers and magazines use multiple columns of text.

      If you really find yourself wanting lines longer than 80 characters, our
      experience is that your code is likely too verbose and could be a little more
      compact. The main offender is usually `VeryLongCamelCaseClassNames`. Ask
      yourself, “Does each word in that type name tell me something critical or
      prevent a name collision?” If not, consider omitting it.

      Note that `dart format` does 99% of this for you, but the last 1% is you. It
      does not split long string literals to fit in 80 columns, so you have to do
      that manually.

      We make an exception for URIs and file paths. When those occur in comments or
      strings (usually in imports and exports), they may remain on a single line even
      if they go over the line limit. This makes it easier to search source files for
      a given path.

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the value of the condition in
      an `if` or loop statement is known to be either always `true` or always
      `false`. An exception is made for a `while` loop whose condition is the
      Boolean literal `true`.

      #### Examples

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the condition will
      always evaluate to `true`:

      ```dart
      void f() {
        [!if (true) {
          print('true');
        }!]
      }
      ```

      The lint will evaluate a subset of expressions that are composed of
      constants, so the following code will also produce this diagnostic because
      the condition will always evaluate to `false`:

      ```dart
      void g(int i) {
        [!if (1 == 0 || 3 > 4) {
          print('false');
        }!]
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If the condition is wrong, then correct the condition so that it's value
      can't be known at compile time:

      ```dart
      void g(int i) {
        if (i == 0 || i > 4) {
          print('false');
        }
      }
      ```

      If the condition is correct, then simplify the code to not evaluate the
      condition:

      ```dart
      void f() {
        print('true');
      }
      ```
    deprecatedDetails: |-
      **DON'T** test for conditions composed only by literals, since the value can be
      inferred at compile time.

      Conditional statements using a condition which cannot be anything but FALSE have
      the effect of making blocks of code non-functional.  If the condition cannot
      evaluate to anything but `true`, the conditional statement is completely
      redundant, and makes the code less readable.
      It is quite likely that the code does not match the programmer's intent.
      Either the condition should be removed or it should be updated so that it does
      not always evaluate to `true` or `false`.

      **BAD:**

      void bad() {
        if (true) {} // LINT
      }

      which is often reasonably preferred to the equivalent `for (;;)`.

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when two or more `case` clauses in

      Any `case` clauses after the first can't be executed, so having duplicate
      `case` clauses is misleading.

      The following code produces this diagnostic because two case clauses have
      the same value (1):

      ```dart

      void f(int v) {
        switch (v) {

          case [!1!]:
            break;
        }
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If one of the clauses should have a different value, then change the value
      of the clause:

      ```dart
      void f(int v) {
        switch (v) {

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the name of a prefix declared
      on an import starts with an underscore.

      Library prefixes are inherently not visible outside the declaring library,
      so a leading underscore indicating private adds no value.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the prefix `_core`
      starts with an underscore:

      ```dart
      import 'dart:core' as [!_core!];
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Remove the underscore:

      ```dart
      import 'dart:core' as core;
      ```
    deprecatedDetails: |-
      **DON'T** use a leading underscore for library prefixes.
      There is no concept of "private" for library prefixes. When one of those has a

      To avoid that, don't use leading underscores in those names.

      **BAD:**
      ```dart
      import 'dart:core' as _core;

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the name of a local variable
      starts with an underscore.

      Local variables are inherently not visible outside the declaring library,
      so a leading underscore indicating private adds no value.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the parameter `_s`
      starts with an underscore:

      ```dart
      int f(String [!_s!]) => _s.length;

      int f(String s) => s.length;
      ```
    deprecatedDetails: |-
      **DON'T** use a leading underscore for identifiers that aren't private. Dart
      uses a leading underscore in an identifier to mark members and top-level
      declarations as private. This trains users to associate a leading underscore
      with one of those kinds of declarations. They see `_` and  think "private".
      There is no concept of "private" for local variables or parameters.  When one of
      those has a name that starts with an underscore, it sends a confusing signal to
      the reader. To avoid that, don't use leading underscores in those names.

      **EXCEPTION:**: An unused parameter can be named `_`, `__`, `___`, etc.  This is
      common practice in callbacks where you are passed a value but you don't need
      to use it. Giving it a name that consists solely of underscores is the idiomatic
      way to indicate that the value isn't used.

      **BAD:**
      ```dart
      void print(String _name) {
        var _size = _name.length;

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an implementation of
      `createState` in a subclass of `StatefulWidget` contains any logic other
      than the return of the result of invoking a zero argument constructor.

      #### Examples

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the constructor
      invocation has arguments:

      ```dart
      import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

      class MyWidget extends StatefulWidget {
        @override
        MyState createState() => [!MyState(0)!];
      }

      class MyState extends State {
        int x;

        MyState(this.x);
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Rewrite the code so that `createState` doesn't contain any logic:

      ```dart
      import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

      class MyWidget extends StatefulWidget {
        @override
        MyState createState() => MyState();
      }

      class MyState extends State {
        int x = 0;

        MyState();
      }
      ```
    deprecatedDetails: |-
      **DON'T** put any logic in `createState()`.

      Implementations of  `createState()` should return a new instance
      of a State object and do nothing more.  Since state access is preferred
      via the `widget` field,  passing data to `State` objects using custom
      constructor parameters should also be avoided and so further, the State
      constructor is required to be passed no arguments.

      **BAD:**
      ```dart
      MyState global;

      class MyStateful extends StatefulWidget {
        @override
        MyState createState() {
          global = MyState();
          return global;
        }
      }

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when either a parameter or local
      variable whose name consists of only underscores is referenced. Such
      names will become non-binding in a future version of the Dart language,
      making the reference illegal.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the name of the
      parameter consists of two underscores:

      ```dart
      // @dart = 3.6
      void f(int __) {
        print([!__!]);
      }
      ```

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the name of the
      local variable consists of a single underscore:

      ```dart
      // @dart = 3.6
      void f() {
        int _ = 0;
        print([!_!]);
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If the variable or parameter is intended to be referenced, then give it a
      name that has at least one non-underscore character:

      ```dart
      void f(int p) {
        print(p);
      }
      ```

      If the variable or parameter is not intended to be referenced, then
      replace the reference with a different expression:

      ```dart
      void f() {
        print(0);
      }

      **DON'T** use wildcard parameters or variables.

      Wildcard parameters and local variables

      Any existing code that uses wildcard parameters or variables will
      break. In anticipation of this change, and to make adoption easier,
      this lint disallows wildcard and variable parameter uses.

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a null check operator is used
      on a variable whose type is `T?`, where `T` is a type parameter that
      allows the type argument to be nullable (either has no bound or has a
      bound that is nullable).

      Given a generic type parameter `T` which has a nullable bound, it is very
      easy to introduce erroneous null checks when working with a variable of
      type `T?`. Specifically, it is not uncommon to have `T? x;` and want to
      assert that `x` has been set to a valid value of type `T`. A common
      mistake is to do so using `x!`. This is almost always incorrect, because
      if `T` is a nullable type, `x` may validly hold `null` as a value of type
      `T`.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because `t` has the type `T?`
      and `T` allows the type argument to be nullable (because it has no
      `extends` clause):

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a class defines a field that
      overrides a field from a superclass.

      Overriding a field with another field causes the object to have two
      distinct fields, but because the fields have the same name only one of the
      fields can be referenced in a given scope. That can lead to confusion
      where a reference to one of the fields can be mistaken for a reference to
      the other.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the field `f` in `B`
      shadows the field `f` in `A`:

      ```dart
      class A {
        int f = 1;
      }

      class B extends A {
        @override
        int [!f!] = 2;
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If the two fields are representing the same property, then remove the
      field from the subclass:

      ```dart
      class A {
        int f = 1;
      }

      class B extends A {}
      ```

      If the two fields should be distinct, then rename one of the fields:

      ```dart
      class A {
        int f = 1;
      }

      class B extends A {
        int g = 2;
      }
      ```

      If the two fields are related in some way, but can't be the same, then
      find a different way to implement the semantics you need.
    deprecatedDetails: |-
      **DON'T** override fields.

      Overriding fields is almost always done unintentionally.  Regardless, it is a
      bad practice to do so.

      **BAD:**
      ```dart
      class Base {
        Object field = 'lorem';

        @override
        final field = 'ipsum'; // LINT
      }

      class Bad2 extends Base {
        @override
        Object something = 'done'; // LINT
      }
      ```

      **GOOD:**
      ```dart
      class Base {
        Object field = 'lorem';

        Object something = 'change';

        final Object newFinal = 'ignore'; // OK
      }

      **NOTE:** This lint is deprecated because it is has not
      been fully functional since at least Dart 2.0.
      Remove all inclusions of this lint from your analysis options.

      **DO** provide doc comments for all public APIs.

      As described in the [pub package layout doc](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/package-layout#implementation-files),
      public APIs consist in everything in your package's `lib` folder, minus
      implementation files in `lib/src`, adding elements explicitly exported with an
      `export` directive.

      For example, given `lib/foo.dart`:
      ```dart
      export 'src/bar.dart' show Bar;
      export 'src/baz.dart';

      class Foo { }

      class _Foo { }
      ```
      its API includes:

      * `Foo` (but not `_Foo`)
      * `Bar` (exported) and
      * all *public* elements in `src/baz.dart`

      All public API members should be documented with `///` doc-style comments.

      **BAD:**
      ```dart
      class Bar {
        void bar();
      }
      ```

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a library has a name that
      doesn't follow these guidelines:

      - Prefix all library names with the package name.
      - Make the entry library have the same name as the package.
      - For all other libraries in a package, after the package name add the
        dot-separated path to the library's Dart file.
      - For libraries under `lib`, omit the top directory name.

      For example, given a package named `my_package`, here are the library
      names for various files in the package:

      ```dart
      // In lib/my_package.dart
      library my_package;

      // In lib/other.dart
      library my_package.other;

      // In lib/foo/bar.dart

      library my_package.example.foo.bar;

      // In lib/src/private.dart
      library my_package.src.private;
      ```

      #### Example

      Assuming that the file containing the following code is not in a file
      named `special.dart` in the `lib` directory of a package named `something`
      (which would be an exception to the rule), the analyzer produces this
      diagnostic because the name of the library doesn't conform to the
      guidelines above:

      ```dart
      library [!something.special!];
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a constructor is used to create
      a list, map, or set, but a literal would produce the same result.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the constructor for
      `Map` is being used to create a map that could also be created using a
      literal:

      ```dart
      var m = [!Map<String, String>()!];
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Use the literal representation:

      ```dart
      var m = <String, String>{};
      ```
    deprecatedDetails: |-
      **DO** use collection literals when possible.

      **BAD:**

      var uniqueNames = Set<String>();
      var ids = LinkedHashSet<int>();

      var uniqueNames = <String>{};
      var ids = <int>{};
      var coordinates = <int, int>{};
      ```

      **EXCEPTIONS:**

      When a `LinkedHashSet` or `LinkedHashMap` is expected, a collection literal is
      not preferred (or allowed).

      ```dart
      void main() {
        LinkedHashSet<int> linkedHashSet =  LinkedHashSet.from([1, 2, 3]); // OK

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an assignment to a variable is
      conditional based on whether the variable has the value `null` and the
      `??=` operator could be used instead.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the parameter `s` is
      being compared to `null` in order to determine whether to assign a
      different value:

      ```dart
      int f(String? s) {
        [!if (s == null) {
          s = '';
        }!]
        return s.length;
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Use the `??=` operator instead of an explicit `if` statement:

      ```dart
      int f(String? s) {
        s ??= '';
        return s.length;
      }

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the invocation of the
      `const` constructor is neither prefixed by `const` nor in a
      [constant context][]:

      ```dart

      @immutable
      class C {
        final f;

        const C(this.f);

      #### Example

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a string literal uses single
      quotes (`'`) when it could use double quotes (`"`) without needing extra
      escapes and without hurting readability.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the string literal

      ```dart

        print("Hello $name");
      }
      ```
    deprecatedDetails: |-
      **DO** use double quotes where they wouldn't require additional escapes.

      That means strings with a double quote may use apostrophes so that the double
      quote isn't escaped (note: we don't lint the other way around, ie, a double
      quoted string with an escaped double quote is not flagged).

      It's also rare, but possible, to have strings within string interpolations.  In
      this case, it's much more readable to use a single quote somewhere.  So single
      quotes are allowed either within, or containing, an interpolated string literal.
      Arguably strings within string interpolations should be its own type of lint.

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a private field is only
      assigned one time. The field can be initialized in multiple constructors
      and still be flagged because only one of those constructors can ever run.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the field `_f` is only
      assigned one time, in the field's initializer:

      ```dart
      class C {
        int [!_f = 1!];

        int get f => _f;
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Mark the field `final`:

      ```dart
      class C {
        final int _f = 1;

        int get f => _f;
      }
      ```

      **DO** prefer declaring private fields as `final` if they are not reassigned
      later in the library.

      Declaring fields as `final` when possible is a good practice because it helps
      avoid accidental reassignments and allows the compiler to do optimizations.

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when `Map.fromIterable` is used to
      build a map that could be built using the `for` element.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because `fromIterable` is
      being used to build a map that could be built using a `for` element:

      ```dart
      void f(Iterable<String> data) {
        <String, int>{
          for (var element in data)

      ```

      **NOTE:**
      This rule will not generate a lint for named parameters unless the parameter
      name and the field name are the same. The reason for this is that resolving
      such a lint would require either renaming the field or renaming the parameter,
      and both of those actions would potentially be a breaking change. For example,
      the following will not generate a lint:

      ```dart
      class Point {
        bool? isEnabled;
        Point({bool? enabled}) {
          this.isEnabled = enabled; // OK

      **NOTE:**
      Also note that it is possible to enforce a type that is stricter than the
      initialized field with an initializing formal parameter.  In the following
      example the unnamed `Bid` constructor requires a non-null `int` despite
      `amount` being declared nullable (`int?`).

      ```dart
      class Bid {

        Bid(int this.amount);

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when string literals and computed
      strings are being concatenated using the `+` operator, but string
      interpolation would achieve the same result.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the String `s` is
      concatenated with other strings using the `+` operator:

      ```dart
      String f(String s) {
        return [!'(' + s!] + ')';
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Use string interpolation:

      ```dart
      String f(List<String> l) {
        return '(${l[0]}, ${l[1]})';
      }

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the result of invoking either
      `Iterable.length` or `Map.length` is compared for equality with zero
      (`0`).

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the result of invoking
      `length` is checked for equality with zero:

      ```dart
      int f(Iterable<int> p) => [!p.length == 0!] ? 0 : p.first;
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Replace the use of `length` with a use of either `isEmpty` or
      `isNotEmpty`:

      ```dart
      void f(Iterable<int> p) => p.isEmpty ? 0 : p.first;
      ```
    deprecatedDetails: |-
      **DON'T** use `length` to see if a collection is empty.

      The `Iterable` contract does not require that a collection know its length or be
      able to provide it in constant time.  Calling `length` just to see if the
      collection contains anything can be painfully slow.

      Instead, there are faster and more readable getters: `isEmpty` and
      `isNotEmpty`.  Use the one that doesn't require you to negate the result.

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an `import` in a library inside

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because it uses a `package:`

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a string literal uses double
      quotes (`"`) when it could use single quotes (`'`) without needing extra
      escapes and without hurting readability.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the string literal
      uses double quotes but doesn't need to:

      ```dart
      void f(String name) {
        print([!"Hello $name"!]);
      }

      #### Common fixes

      Use single quotes in place of double quotes:

      void f(String name) {
        print('Hello $name');
      }
      ```
    deprecatedDetails: |-
      **DO** use single quotes where they wouldn't require additional escapes.

      That means strings with an apostrophe may use double quotes so that the
      apostrophe isn't escaped (note: we don't lint the other way around, ie, a single
      quoted string with an escaped apostrophe is not flagged).

      It's also rare, but possible, to have strings within string interpolations.  In
      this case, it's much more readable to use a double quote somewhere.  So double
      quotes are allowed either within, or containing, an interpolated string literal.
      Arguably strings within string interpolations should be its own type of lint.

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a variable without an
      initializer doesn't have an explicit type annotation.

      Without either a type annotation or an initializer, a variable has the
      type `dynamic`, which allows any value to be assigned to the variable,
      often causing hard to identify bugs.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the variable `r`
      doesn't have either a type annotation or an initializer:

      ```dart
      Object f() {
        var [!r!];
        r = '';
        return r;
      }

      ```dart
      Object f() {
        var r = '';
        return r;
      }
      ```

      If the variable can't be initialized, then add an explicit type
      annotation:

      ```dart
      Object f() {
        String r;

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the function `f` is
      annotated with `deprecated`:

      ```dart
      [!@deprecated!]
      void f() {}
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Convert the code to use the longer form:

      ```dart
      @Deprecated('Use g instead. Will be removed in 4.0.0.')
      void f() {}
      ```

      **DO** specify a deprecation message (with migration instructions and/or a
      removal schedule) in the `Deprecated` constructor.

      **BAD:**
      ```dart
      @deprecated
      void oldFunction(arg1, arg2) {}
      ```

      **GOOD:**
      ```dart
      @Deprecated("""
      [oldFunction] is being deprecated in favor of [newFunction] (with slightly
      different parameters; see [newFunction] for more information). [oldFunction]
      will be removed on or after the 4.0.0 release.

        /// Start doing your thing.
        void start() => _start();

        _start();
      }
      ```

      In case a public member overrides a member it is up to the declaring member
      to provide documentation.  For example, in the following, `Sub` needn't
      document `init` (though it certainly may, if there's need).

      **GOOD:**
      ```dart
      /// Base of all things.
      abstract class Base {
        /// Initialize the base.
        void init();
      }

      /// A sub base.
      class Sub extends Base {
        @override
        void init() { ... }
      }
      ```

      Note that consistent with `dart doc`, an exception to the rule is made when
      documented getters have corresponding undocumented setters.  In this case the
      setters inherit the docs from the getters.

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a getter invokes itself,
      resulting in an infinite loop.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the getter `count`
      invokes itself:

      class C {
        int _count = 0;

        int get [!count!] => count;

      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Change the getter to not invoke itself:

      ```dart
      class C {
        int _count = 0;

        int get count => _count;
      }

      invocation specifies the values of both `height` and `width` as either
      `0.0` or `double.infinity`.

      #### Examples

      The following code produces this diagnostic because both the `height` and
      `width` are `0.0`:

      ```dart

      Widget build() {
        return SizedBox.shrink(

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the unnamed
      constructor is after the named constructor:

      ```dart

        C.named();

        [!C!]();

      ```dart
      class C {
        C();

        C.named();
      }

      Do type annotate initialized local variables when the type is non-obvious.

      Type annotations on local variables can serve as a request for type inference,

      allowing the compiler and analyzer to solve the possibly complex task of

      An expression is considered to have a non-obvious type when it does not
      have an obvious type.

      An expression e has an obvious type in the following cases:

      - e is a non-collection literal. For instance, 1, true, 'Hello, $name!'.
      - e is a collection literal with actual type arguments. For instance,
        <int, bool>{}.

        obvious type, and all elements have the same type. For instance, [1, 2] and
        { [true, false], [] }, but not [1, 1.5].
      - e is a map literal where all key-value pair have a key with an obvious type
        and a value with an obvious type, and all keys have the same type, and all
        values have the same type. For instance, { #a: <int>[] }, but not
        {1: 1, 2: true}.
      - e is an instance creation expression whose class part is not raw. For
        instance C(14) if C is a non-generic class, or C<int>(14) if C accepts one
        type argument, but not C(14) if C accepts one or more type arguments.
      - e is a cascade whose target has an obvious type. For instance,

      **DO** place the `super` call last in a constructor initialization list.

      Field initializers are evaluated in the order that they appear in the
      constructor initialization list.  If you place a `super()` call in the middle of
      an initializer list, the superclass's initializers will be evaluated right then
      before evaluating the rest of the subclass's initializers.

      What it doesn't mean is that the superclass's constructor body will be executed
      then.  That always happens after all initializers are run regardless of where
      `super` appears.  It's vanishingly rare that the order of initializers matters,
      so the placement of `super` in the list almost never matters either.

      Getting in the habit of placing it last improves consistency, visually
      reinforces when the superclass's constructor body is run, and may help

      Type annotations are important documentation for how a library should be used.
      Annotating the parameter and return types of public methods and functions helps
      users understand what the API expects and what it provides.

      Note that if a public API accepts a range of values that Dart's type system
      cannot express, then it is acceptable to leave that untyped.  In that case, the
      implicit `dynamic` is the correct type for the API.

      For code internal to a library (either private, or things like nested functions)
      annotate where you feel it helps, but don't feel that you *must* provide them.

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an initializing formal
      parameter (`this.x`) or a super parameter (`super.x`) has an explicit type
      annotation that is the same as the field or overridden parameter.

      If a constructor parameter is using `this.x` to initialize a field, then
      the type of the parameter is implicitly the same type as the field. If a
      constructor parameter is using `super.x` to forward to a super
      constructor, then the type of the parameter is implicitly the same as the
      super constructor parameter.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the parameter `this.c`

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an instance of `Future` is
      returned from an invocation within an `async` (or `async*`) method or
      function and the future is neither awaited nor passed to the `unawaited`
      function.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the function `g`
      returns a future, but the future isn't awaited:

      ```dart
      Future<void> f() async {
        [!g();!]
      }

      Future<int> g() => Future.value(0);
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If the future needs to complete before the following code is executed,
      then add an `await` before the invocation:

      ```dart
      Future<void> f() async {
        await g();
      }

      Future<int> g() => Future.value(0);
      ```

      If the future doesn't need to complete before the following code is
      executed, then wrap the `Future`-returning invocation in an invocation of
      the `unawaited` function:

      ```dart
      import 'dart:async';

      Future<void> f() async {
        unawaited(g());
      }

      Future<int> g() => Future.value(0);
      ```
    deprecatedDetails: |-
      **DO** await functions that return a `Future` inside of an async function body.

      It's easy to forget await in async methods as naming conventions usually don't
      tell us if a method is sync or async (except for some in `dart:io`).

      When you really _do_ want to start a fire-and-forget `Future`, the recommended
      way is to use `unawaited` from `dart:async`. The `// ignore` and
      `// ignore_for_file` comments also work.

      **BAD:**
      ```dart
      void main() async {
        doSomething(); // Likely a bug.
      }
      ```

      **GOOD:**
      ```dart
      Future doSomething() => ...;

      void main() async {
        await doSomething();

        unawaited(doSomething()); // Explicitly-ignored fire-and-forget.

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a documentation comment
      contains angle bracketed text (`<...>`) that isn't one of the allowed
      exceptions.

      Such text is interpreted by markdown to be an HTML tag, which is rarely
      what was intended.

      See the [lint rule description](https://dart.dev/tools/linter-rules/unintended_html_in_doc_comment)
      for the list of allowed exceptions.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the documentation
      comment contains the text `<int>`, which isn't one of the allowed
      exceptions:

      ```dart
      /// Converts a List[!<int>!] to a comma-separated String.
      String f(List<int> l) => '';
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If the text was intended to be part of a code span, then add backticks
      around the code:

      ```dart
      /// Converts a `List<int>` to a comma-separated String.
      String f(List<int> l) => '';
      ```

      If the text was intended to be part of a link, then add square brackets
      around the code:

      ```dart
      /// Converts a [List<int>] to a comma-separated String.
      String f(List<int> l) => '';
      ```

      If the text was intended to be printed as-is, including the angle
      brackets, then add backslash escapes before the angle brackets:

      ```dart
      /// Converts a List\<int\> to a comma-separated String.
      String f(List<int> l) => '';
      ```
    deprecatedDetails: |-
      **DON'T** use angle-bracketed text, `<…>`, in a doc comment unless you want to
      write an HTML tag or link.

      Markdown allows HTML tags as part of the Markdown code, so you can write, for
      example, `T<sub>1</sub>`. Markdown does not restrict the allowed tags, it just
      includes the tags verbatim in the output.

      Dartdoc only allows some known and valid HTML tags, and will omit any disallowed
      HTML tag from the output. See the list of allowed tags and directives below.
      Your doc comment should not contain any HTML tags that are not on this list.

      Markdown also allows you to write an "auto-link" to an URL as for example
      `<https://example.com/page.html>`, delimited only by `<...>`. Such a link is
      allowed by Dartdoc as well.
      A `<...>` delimited text is an auto-link if it is a valid absolute URL, starting
      with a scheme of at least two characters followed by a colon, like
      `<mailto:mr_example@example.com>`.

      Any other other occurrence of `<word...>` or `</word...>` is likely a mistake
      and this lint will warn about it.
      If something looks like an HTML tag, meaning it starts with `<` or `</`
      and then a letter, and it has a later matching `>`, then it's considered an
      invalid HTML tag unless it is an auto-link, or it starts with an *allowed*
      HTML tag.

      Such a mistake can, for example, happen if writing Dart code with type arguments
      outside of a code span, for example `The type List<int> is ...`, where `<int>`
      looks like an HTML tag. Missing the end quote of a code span can have the same
      effect: ``The type `List<int> is ...`` will also treat `<int>` as an HTML tag.

      Allows the following HTML directives: HTML comments, `<!-- text -->`, processing
      instructions, `<?...?>`, CDATA-sections, and `<[CDATA...]>`.
      Allows DartDoc links like `[List<int>]` which are not after a `]` or before a
      `[` or `(`, and allows the following recognized HTML tags:
      `a`, `abbr`, `address`, `area`, `article`, `aside`, `audio`, `b`,
      `bdi`, `bdo`, `blockquote`, `br`, `button`, `canvas`, `caption`,
      `cite`, `code`, `col`, `colgroup`, `data`, `datalist`, `dd`, `del`,
      `dfn`, `div`, `dl`, `dt`, `em`, `fieldset`, `figcaption`, `figure`,
      `footer`, `form`, `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6`, `header`, `hr`,
      `i`, `iframe`, `img`, `input`, `ins`, `kbd`, `keygen`, `label`,

      **AVOID** wrapping fields in getters and setters just to be "safe".

      In Java and C#, it's common to hide all fields behind getters and setters (or
      properties in C#), even if the implementation just forwards to the field.  That
      way, if you ever need to do more work in those members, you can do it without needing
      to touch the callsites.  This is because calling a getter method is different
      than accessing a field in Java, and accessing a property isn't binary-compatible
      with accessing a raw field in C#.

      Dart doesn't have this limitation.  Fields and getters/setters are completely
      indistinguishable.  You can expose a field in a class and later wrap it in a
      getter and setter without having to touch any code that uses that field.

      has the modifier `late` even though it has an initializer:

      ```dart
      class C {
        static [!late!] String c = '';
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Remove the keyword `late`:

      ```dart
      class C {
        static String c = '';
      }
      ```
    deprecatedDetails: |-
      **DO** not specify the `late` modifier for top-level and static variables
      when the declaration contains an initializer.

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a `library` directive specifies
      a name.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the `library`
      directive includes a name:

      ```dart
      library [!some.name!];

      class C {}

      #### Common fixes

      Remove the name from the `library` directive:

      ```dart
      library;

      class C {}
      ```

      If the library has any parts, then any `part of` declarations that use
      the library name should be updated to use the URI of the library instead.
    deprecatedDetails: |-
      **DON'T** have a library name in a `library` declaration.

      Library names are not necessary.

      A library does not need a library declaration, but one can be added to attach
      library documentation and library metadata to. A declaration of `library;` is
      sufficient for those uses.

      The only *use* of a library name is for a `part` file to refer back to its
      owning library, but part files should prefer to use a string URI to refer back
      to the library file, not a library name.

      If a library name is added to a library declaration, it introduces the risk of
      name *conflicts*. It's a compile-time error if two libraries in the same program
      have the same library name. To avoid that, library names tend to be long,
      including the package name and path, just to avoid accidental name clashes. That
      makes such library names hard to read, and not even useful as documentation.

      /// This library has a long name.

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an instance member overrides an
      inherited member but only invokes the overridden member with exactly the
      same arguments.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the method `D.m`
      doesn't do anything other than invoke the overridden method:

      ```dart
      class C {
        int m(int x) => x;
      }

      class D extends C {
        @override
        int [!m!](int x) => super.m(x);
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If the method should do something more than what the overridden method
      does, then implement the missing functionality:

      ```dart
      class C {
        int m(int x) => x;
      }

      class D extends C {
        @override
        int m(int x) => super.m(x) + 1;
      }
      ```

      If the overridden method should be modified by changing the return type or
      one or more of the parameter types, making one of the parameters
      `covariant`, having a documentation comment, or by having additional
      annotations, then update the code:

      ```dart
      import 'package:meta/meta.dart';

      class C {
        int m(int x) => x;
      }

      class D extends C {
        @mustCallSuper
        @override
        int m(int x) => super.m(x);
      }
      ```

      If the overriding method doesn't change or enhance the semantics of the
      code, then remove it:

      ```dart
      class C {
        int m(int x) => x;
      }

      class D extends C {}
      ```
    deprecatedDetails: |-
      **DON'T** override a method to do a super method invocation with same parameters.

        @override
        void foo() {
          doSomethingElse();
        }
      }
      ```

      It's valid to override a member in the following cases:

      * if a type (return type or a parameter type) is not the exactly the same as the
        super member,
      * if the `covariant` keyword is added to one of the parameters,
      * if documentation comments are present on the member,
      * if the member has annotations other than `@override`,
      * if the member is not annotated with `@protected`, and the super member is.

      `noSuchMethod` is a special method and is not checked by this rule.

      Parentheses are considered unnecessary if they do not change the meaning of the
      code and they do not improve the readability of the code. The goal is not to
      force all developers to maintain the expression precedence table in their heads,
      which is why the second condition is included. Examples of this condition
      include:

      * cascade expressions - it is sometimes not clear what the target of a cascade
        expression is, especially with assignments, or nested cascades. For example,
        the expression `a.b = (c..d)`.
      * expressions with whitespace between tokens - it can look very strange to see
        an expression like `!await foo` which is valid and equivalent to
        `!(await foo)`.
      * logical expressions - parentheses can improve the readability of the implicit
        grouping defined by precedence. For example, the expression
        `(a && b) || c && d`.

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the keyword `this` is used to
      access a member that isn't shadowed.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the use of `this` to
      access the field `_f` isn't necessary:

      ```dart
      class C {
        int _f = 2;

        int get f => [!this!]._f;
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Remove the `this.`:

      ```dart
      class C {
        int _f = 2;

        int get f => _f;
      }
      ```

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when `toList` is used to convert an
      `Iterable` to a `List` just before a spread operator is applied to the
      list. The spread operator can be applied to any `Iterable`, so the
      conversion isn't necessary.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because `toList` is invoked on
      the result of `map`, which is an `Iterable` that the spread operator could
      be applied to directly:

      ```dart
      List<String> toLowercase(List<String> strings) {
        return [
          ...strings.map((String s) => s.toLowerCase()).[!toList!](),
        ];
      }
      ```

      ```dart
      List<String> toLowercase(List<String> strings) {
        return [

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when two objects are being compared
      and neither of the static types of the two objects is a subtype of the
      other.

      Such a comparison will usually return `false` and might not reflect the
      programmer's intent.

      There can be false positives. For example, a class named `Point` might
      have subclasses named `CartesianPoint` and `PolarPoint`, neither of which
      is a subtype of the other, but it might still be appropriate to test the
      equality of instances.

      As a concrete case, the classes `Int64` and `Int32` from `package:fixnum`
      allow comparing instances to an `int` provided the `int` is on the
      right-hand side. This case is specifically allowed by the diagnostic, but
      other such cases are not.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the string `s` is
      being compared to the integer `1`:

      ```dart
      bool f(String s) {
        return s [!==!] 1;
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Replace one of the operands with something compatible with the other
      operand:

      ```dart
      bool f(String s) {
        return s.length == 1;
      }
      ```

      **DON'T** Compare references of unrelated types for equality.

      Comparing references of a type where neither is a subtype of the other most
      likely will return `false` and might not reflect programmer's intent.

      `Int64` and `Int32` from `package:fixnum` allow comparing to `int` provided
      the `int` is on the right hand side. The lint allows this as a special case.

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an instance member has a result
      type which is [contravariant or invariant](https://dart.dev/resources/glossary#variance)
      in a type parameter of the enclosing declaration. The result type of a
      variable is its type, and the result type of a getter or method is its
      return type. This lint warns against such members because they are likely
      to cause a failing type check at run time, with no static warning or error
      at the call site.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because `X` occurs
      as a parameter type in the type of `f`, which is a
      contravariant occurrence of this type parameter:

      ```dart
      class C<X> {
        bool Function([!X!]) f;
        C(this.f);
      }
      ```

      This is unsafe: If `c` has static type `C<num>` and run-time type `C<int>`
      then `c.f` will throw. Hence, every invocation `c.f(a)` will also throw,
      even in the case where `a` has a correct type as an argument to `c.f`.

      #### Common fixes

      If the linted member is or can be private then you may be able
      to enforce that it is never accessed on any other receiver than `this`.
      This is sufficient to ensure that that the run-time type error does not
      occur. For example:

      ```dart
      class C<X> {
        // NB: Ensure manually that `_f` is only accessed on `this`.
        // ignore: unsafe_variance
        bool Function(X) _f;

        C(this._f);

        // We can write a forwarding method to allow clients to call `_f`.
        bool f(X x) => _f(x);
      }
      ```

      You can eliminate the unsafe variance by using a more general type for
      the linted member. In this case you may need to check the run-time type
      and perform a downcast at call sites.

      ```dart
      class C<X> {
        bool Function(Never) f;
        C(this.f);
      }
      ```

      If `c` has static type `C<num>` then you may test the type. For example,
      `c.f is bool Function(num)`. You may safely call it with an argument of
      type `num` if it has that type.

      You can also eliminate the unsafe variance by using a much more general
      type like `Function`, which is essentially the type `dynamic` for
      functions.

      ```dart
      class C<X> {
        Function f;
        C(this.f);
      }
      ```

      This will make `c.f(a)` dynamically safe: It will throw if and only if the
      argument `a` does not have the type required by the function. This is
      better than the original version because it will not throw because of a
      mismatched static type. It only throws when it _must_ throw for soundness
      reasons.
    deprecatedDetails: |-
      An instance variable whose type contains a type parameter of the
      enclosing class, mixin, or enum in a non-covariant position is
      likely to cause run-time failures due to failing type
      checks. For example, in `class C<X> {...}`, an instance variable
      of the form `void Function(X) myVariable;` may cause this kind
      of run-time failure.

      The same is true for a getter or method whose return type has a
      non-covariant occurrence of a type parameter of the enclosing
      declaration.

      This lint flags this kind of member declaration.

      **BAD:**
      ```dart
      class C<X> {
        final bool Function([!X!]) fun; // LINT
        C(this.fun);
      }

      void main() {
        C<num> c = C<int>((i) => i.isEven);
        c.fun(10); // Throws.
      }
      ```

      The problem is that `X` occurs as a parameter type in the type
      of `fun`.

      One way to reduce the potential for run-time type errors is to
      ensure that the non-covariant member `fun` is _only_ used on
      `this`. We cannot strictly enforce this, but we can make it
      private and add a forwarding method `fun` such that we can check
      locally in the same library that this constraint is satisfied:

      **BETTER:**
      ```dart
      class C<X> {
        // ignore: unsafe_variance
        final bool Function(X) _fun;
        bool fun(X x) => _fun(x);
        C(this._fun);
      }

      void main() {
        C<num> c = C<int>((i) => i.isEven);
        c.fun(10); // Succeeds.
      }
      ```

      A fully safe approach requires a feature that Dart does not yet
      have, namely statically checked variance. With that, we could
      specify that the type parameter `X` is invariant (`inout X`).

      It is possible to emulate invariance without support for statically
      checked variance. This puts some restrictions on the creation of
      subtypes, but faithfully provides the typing that `inout` would
      give:

      **GOOD:**
      ```dart
      typedef Inv<X> = X Function(X);
      typedef C<X> = _C<X, Inv<X>>;

      class _C<X, Invariance extends Inv<X>> {
        // ignore: unsafe_variance
        final bool Function(X) fun; // Safe!
        _C(this.fun);
      }

      void main() {
        C<int> c = C<int>((i) => i.isEven);
        c.fun(10); // Succeeds.
      }
      ```

      With this approach, `C<int>` is not a subtype of `C<num>`, so
      `c` must have a different declared type.

      Another possibility is to declare the variable to have a safe
      but more general type. It is then safe to use the variable
      itself, but every invocation will have to be checked at run
      time:

      **HONEST:**
      ```dart
      class C<X> {
        final bool Function(Never) fun;
        C(this.fun);
      }

      void main() {
        C<num> c = C<int>((int i) => i.isEven);
        var cfun = c.fun; // Local variable, enables promotion.
        if (cfun is bool Function(int)) cfun(10); // Succeeds.
        if (cfun is bool Function(bool)) cfun(true); // Not called.
      }

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a `BuildContext` is referenced
      by a `StatefulWidget` after an asynchronous gap without first checking the
      `mounted` property.

      Storing a `BuildContext` for later use can lead to difficult-to-diagnose
      crashes. Asynchronous gaps implicitly store a `BuildContext`, making them
      easy to overlook for diagnosis.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the `context` is
      passed to a constructor after the `await`:

      ```dart
      import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

      class MyWidget extends Widget {
        void onButtonTapped(BuildContext context) async {
          await Future.delayed(const Duration(seconds: 1));
          Navigator.of([!context!]).pop();
        }
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If you can remove the asynchronous gap, do so:

      ```dart
      import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

      class MyWidget extends Widget {
        void onButtonTapped(BuildContext context) {
          Navigator.of(context).pop();
        }
      }
      ```

      If you can't remove the asynchronous gap, then use `mounted` to guard the
      use of the `context`:

      ```dart
      import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

      class MyWidget extends Widget {
        void onButtonTapped(BuildContext context) async {
          await Future.delayed(const Duration(seconds: 1));
          if (context.mounted) {
            Navigator.of(context).pop();
          }
        }
      }

      **DON'T** use `BuildContext` across asynchronous gaps.

      Storing `BuildContext` for later usage can easily lead to difficult-to-diagnose
      crashes. Asynchronous gaps are implicitly storing `BuildContext` and are some of
      the easiest to overlook when writing code.

      When a `BuildContext` is used, a `mounted` property must be checked after an
      asynchronous gap, depending on how the `BuildContext` is accessed:

      * When using a `State`'s `context` property, the `State`'s `mounted` property
        must be checked.
      * For other `BuildContext` instances (like a local variable or function
        argument), the `BuildContext`'s `mounted` property must be checked.

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a `Container` is created that
      only sets the color.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the only attribute of
      the container that is set is the `color`:

      ```dart
      import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

      Widget build() {
        return [!Container!](
          color: Colors.red,
          child: const Text('hello'),
        );
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Replace the `Container` with a `ColoredBox`:

      ```dart
      import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

      Widget build() {
        return ColoredBox(
          color: Colors.red,
          child: const Text('hello'),
        );
      }
      ```
    deprecatedDetails: |-
      **DO** use `ColoredBox` when `Container` has only a `Color`.

      A `Container` is a heavier Widget than a `ColoredBox`, and as bonus,
      `ColoredBox` has a `const` constructor.

      **BAD:**
      ```dart
      Widget buildArea() {
        return Container(
          color: Colors.blue,
          child: const Text('hello'),

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the argument to the constructor
      of the `Color` class is a literal integer that isn't represented as an
      8-digit hexadecimal integer.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the argument (`1`)

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a constructor in a subclass of
      `Widget` that isn't private to its library doesn't have a parameter named
      `key`.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the constructor for

      ```dart
      import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

      class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
        [!MyWidget!]({required int height});

      ```dart
      import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

      class [!MyWidget!] extends StatelessWidget {}

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a private field or variable is
      marked as being nullable, but every reference assumes that the variable is
      never `null`.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the private top-level
      variable `_i` is nullable, but every reference assumes that it will not be
      `null`:

      ```dart
      void f() {
        _i!.abs();
      }

      int? [!_i!];
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Mark the variable or field as being both non-nullable and `late` to
      indicate that it will always be assigned a non-null:

      ```dart
      void f() {
        _i.abs();
      }

      late int _i;
      ```
    deprecatedDetails: |-
      Use `late` for private members with non-nullable types that are always expected
      to be non-null. Thus it's clear that the field is not expected to be `null`
      and it avoids null checks.

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a `part of` directive uses a
      library name to refer to the library that the part is a part of.

      #### Example

      Given a file named `lib.dart` that contains the following:

      ```dart
      %uri="lib/lib.dart"
      library lib;

      part 'test.dart';
      ```

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the `part of`
      directive uses the name of the library rather than the URI of the library
      it's part of:

      ```dart
      [!part of lib;!]
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Use a URI to reference the library:

      ```dart

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a parameter to a constructor is
      passed to a super constructor without being referenced or modified and a
      `super` parameter isn't used.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the parameters of the
      constructor for `B` are only used as arguments to the super constructor:

      ```dart
      class A {
        A({int? x, int? y});

      class B extends A {
        [!B!]({int? x, int? y}) : super(x: x, y: y);
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Use a `super` parameter to pass the arguments:

      ```dart
      class A {
        A({int? x, int? y});
      }

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the result of dividing two
      numbers is converted to an integer using `toInt`.

      Dart has a built-in integer division operator that is both more efficient
      and more concise.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the result of dividing
      `x` and `y` is converted to an integer using `toInt`:

      ```dart
      int divide(int x, int y) => [!(x / y).toInt()!];
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Use the integer division operator (`~/`):

      ```dart
      int divide(int x, int y) => x ~/ y;
      ```
    deprecatedDetails: |-
      **DO** use truncating division, '~/', instead of regular division ('/') followed
      by 'toInt()'.

      Dart features a "truncating division" operator which is the same operation as
      division followed by truncation, but which is more concise and expressive, and
      may be more performant on some platforms, for certain inputs.

      **BAD:**
      ```dart
      var x = (2 / 3).toInt();

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the string passed to the

      expression.

      A regular expression created with invalid syntax will throw a
      `FormatException` at runtime.

      ```dart
      var r = RegExp([!r'('!]);

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a value is assigned to a
      variable of type `void`.

      It isn't possible to access the value of such a variable, so the
      assignment has no value.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the field `value` has
      the type `void`, but a value is being assigned to it:

      ```dart
      class A<T> {
        T? value;
      }

      void f(A<void> a) {
        [!a.value = 1!];
      }
      ```

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the type of the
      parameter `p` in the method `m` is `void`, but a value is being assigned
      to it in the invocation:

      ```dart
      class A<T> {
        void m(T p) { }
      }

      void f(A<void> a) {
        a.m([!1!]);
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If the type of the variable is incorrect, then change the type of the
      variable:

      ```dart
      class A<T> {
        T? value;
      }

      void f(A<int> a) {
        a.value = 1;
      }
      ```

      If the type of the variable is correct, then remove the assignment:

      ```dart
      class A<T> {
        T? value;
      }

      void f(A<void> a) {}
      ```
    deprecatedDetails: |-
      **DON'T** assign to `void`.

      class A<T> {
        T value;
        void test(T arg) { }
      }

        A<void> a = A<void>();
        a.value = 1; // LINT
        a.test(1); // LINT
      }
      ```
