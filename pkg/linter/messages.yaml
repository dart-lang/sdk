LintCode:
  always_declare_return_types:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a method or function doesn't
      have an explicit return type.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the function `f`
      doesn't have a return type:

      ```dart
      [!f!]() {}
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Add an explicit return type:

      ```dart
      void f() {}
      ```
  always_put_control_body_on_new_line:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the code being controlled by a
      control flow statement (`if`, `for`, `while`, or `do`) is on the same line
      as the control flow statement.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the `return` statement
      is on the same line as the `if` that controls whether the `return` will be
      executed:

      ```dart
      void f(bool b) {
        if (b) [!return!];
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Put the controlled statement onto a separate, indented, line:

      ```dart
      void f(bool b) {
        if (b)
          return;
      }
      ```
  always_put_required_named_parameters_first:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when required named parameters occur
      after optional named parameters.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the required parameter
      `x` is after the optional parameter `y`:

      ```dart
      void f({int? y, required int [!x!]}) {}
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Reorder the parameters so that all required named parameters are before
      any optional named parameters:

      ```dart
      void f({required int x, int? y}) {}
      ```
  always_use_package_imports:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an `import` in a library inside
      the `lib` directory uses a relative path to import another library inside
      the `lib` directory of the same package.

      #### Example

      Given that a file named `a.dart` and the code below are both inside the
      `lib` directory of the same package, the following code produces this
      diagnostic because a relative URI is used to import `a.dart`:

      ```dart
      import [!'a.dart'!];
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Use a package import:

      ```dart
      import 'package:p/a.dart';
      ```
  annotate_overrides:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a member overrides an inherited
      member, but isn't annotated with `@override`.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the method `m` in the
      class `B` overrides the method with the same name in class `A`, but isn't
      marked as an intentional override:

      ```dart
      class A {
        void m() {}
      }

      class B extends A {
        void [!m!]() {}
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If the member in the subclass is intended to override the member in the
      superclass, then add an `@override` annotation:

      ```dart
      class A {
        void m() {}
      }

      class B extends A {
        @override
        void m() {}
      }
      ```

      If the member in the subclass is not intended to override the member in
      the superclass, then rename one of the members:

      ```dart
      class A {
        void m() {}
      }

      class B extends A {
        void m2() {}
      }
      ```
  avoid_empty_else:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the statement after an `else`
      is an empty statement (a semicolon).

      For more information, see the documentation for
      [`avoid_empty_else`](https://dart.dev/diagnostics/avoid_empty_else).

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the statement
      following the `else` is an empty statement:

      ```dart
      void f(int x, int y) {
        if (x > y)
          print("1");
        else [!;!]
          print("2");
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If the statement after the empty statement is intended to be executed only
      when the condition is `false`, then remove the empty statement:

      ```dart
      void f(int x, int y) {
        if (x > y)
          print("1");
        else
          print("2");
      }
      ```

      If there is no code that is intended to be executed only when the
      condition is `false`, then remove the whole `else` clause:

      ```dart
      void f(int x, int y) {
        if (x > y)
          print("1");
        print("2");
      }
      ```
  avoid_function_literals_in_foreach_calls:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the argument to
      `Iterable.forEach` is a closure.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the argument to the
      invocation of `forEach` is a closure:

      ```dart
      void f(Iterable<String> s) {
        s.[!forEach!]((e) => print(e));
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If the closure can be replaced by a tear-off, then replace the closure:

      ```dart
      void f(Iterable<String> s) {
        s.forEach(print);
      }
      ```

      If the closure can't be replaced by a tear-off, then use a `for` loop to
      iterate over the elements:

      ```dart
      void f(Iterable<String> s) {
        for (var e in s) {
          print(e);
        }
      }
      ```
  avoid_init_to_null:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a nullable variable is
      explicitly initialized to `null`. The variable can be a local variable,
      field, or top-level variable.

      A variable or field that isn't explicitly initialized automatically gets
      initialized to `null`. There's no concept of "uninitialized memory" in
      Dart.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the variable `f` is
      explicitly initialized to `null`:

      ```dart
      class C {
        int? [!f = null!];

        void m() {
          if (f != null) {
            print(f);
          }
        }
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Remove the unnecessary initialization:

      ```dart
      class C {
        int? f;

        void m() {
          if (f != null) {
            print(f);
          }
        }
      }
      ```
  avoid_print:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the function `print` is invoked
      in production code.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the function `print`
      can't be invoked in production:

      ```dart
      void f(int x) {
        [!print!]('x = $x');
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If you're writing code that uses Flutter, then use the function
      [`debugPrint`][debugPrint], guarded by a test
      using [`kDebugMode`][kDebugMode]:

      ```dart
      import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';

      void f(int x) {
        if (kDebugMode) {
          debugPrint('x = $x');
        }
      }
      ```

      If you're writing code that doesn't use Flutter, then use a logging
      service, such as [`package:logging`][package-logging], to write the
      information.
  avoid_relative_lib_imports:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the URI in an `import`
      directive has `lib` in the path.

      #### Example

      Assuming that there is a file named `a.dart` in the `lib` directory:

      ```dart
      %uri="lib/a.dart"
      class A {}
      ```

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the import contains a
      path that includes `lib`:

      ```dart
      import [!'../lib/a.dart'!];
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Rewrite the import to not include `lib` in the URI:

      ```dart
      import 'a.dart';
      ```
  avoid_renaming_method_parameters:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a method that overrides a
      method from a superclass changes the names of the parameters.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the parameter of the
      method `m` in `B` is named `b`, which is different from the name of the
      overridden method's parameter in `A`:

      ```dart
      class A {
        void m(int a) {}
      }

      class B extends A {
        @override
        void m(int [!b!]) {}
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Rename one of the parameters so that they are the same:

      ```dart
      class A {
        void m(int a) {}
      }

      class B extends A {
        @override
        void m(int a) {}
      }
      ```
  avoid_return_types_on_setters:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a setter has an explicit return
      type.

      Setters never return a value, so declaring the return type of one is
      redundant.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the setter `s` has an
      explicit return type (`void`):

      ```dart
      [!void!] set s(int p) {}
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Remove the return type:

      ```dart
      set s(int p) {}
      ```
  avoid_returning_null_for_void:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a function that has a return
      type of `void` explicitly returns `null`.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because there is an explicit
      return of `null` in a `void` function:

      ```dart
      void f() {
        [!return null;!]
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Remove the unnecessary explicit `null`:

      ```dart
      void f() {
        return;
      }
      ```
  avoid_shadowing_type_parameters:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a type parameter shadows a type
      parameter from an enclosing declaration.

      Shadowing a type parameter with a different type parameter can lead to
      subtle bugs that are difficult to debug.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the type parameter `T`
      defined by the method `m` shadows the type parameter `T` defined by the
      class `C`:

      ```dart
      class C<T> {
        void m<[!T!]>() {}
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Rename one of the type parameters:

      ```dart
      class C<T> {
        void m<S>() {}
      }
      ```
  avoid_single_cascade_in_expression_statements:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a single cascade operator is
      used and the value of the expression isn't being used for anything (such
      as being assigned to a variable or being passed as an argument).

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the value of the
      cascade expression `s..length` isn't being used:

      ```dart
      void f(String s) {
        [!s..length!];
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Replace the cascade operator with a simple access operator:

      ```dart
      void f(String s) {
        s.length;
      }
      ```
  avoid_slow_async_io:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an asynchronous file I/O method
      with a synchronous equivalent is used.

      The following are the specific flagged asynchronous methods:

      - `Directory.exists`
      - `Directory.stat`
      - `File.lastModified`
      - `File.exists`
      - `File.stat`
      - `FileSystemEntity.isDirectory`
      - `FileSystemEntity.isFile`
      - `FileSystemEntity.isLink`
      - `FileSystemEntity.type`

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the async method
      `exists` is invoked:

      ```dart
      import 'dart:io';

      Future<void> g(File f) async {
        await [!f.exists()!];
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Use the synchronous version of the method:

      ```dart
      import 'dart:io';

      void g(File f) {
        f.existsSync();
      }
      ```
  avoid_type_to_string:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the method `toString` is
      invoked on a value whose static type is `Type`.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the method `toString`
      is invoked on the `Type` returned by `runtimeType`:

      ```dart
      bool isC(Object o) => o.runtimeType.[!toString!]() == 'C';

      class C {}
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If it's essential that the type is exactly the same, then use an explicit
      comparison:

      ```dart
      bool isC(Object o) => o.runtimeType == C;

      class C {}
      ```

      If it's alright for instances of subtypes of the type to return `true`,
      then use a type check:

      ```dart
      bool isC(Object o) => o is C;

      class C {}
      ```
  avoid_types_as_parameter_names:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the name of a parameter in a
      parameter list is the same as a visible type (a type whose name is in
      scope).

      This often indicates that the intended name of the parameter is missing,
      causing the name of the type to be used as the name of the parameter
      rather than the type of the parameter. Even when that's not the case (the
      name of the parameter is intentional), the name of the parameter will
      shadow the existing type, which can lead to bugs that are difficult to
      diagnose.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the function `f` has a
      parameter named `int`, which shadows the type `int` from `dart:core`:

      ```dart
      void f([!int!]) {}
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If the parameter name is missing, then add a name for the parameter:

      ```dart
      void f(int x) {}
      ```

      If the parameter is intended to have an implicit type of `dynamic`, then
      rename the parameter so that it doesn't shadow the name of any visible type:

      ```dart
      void f(int_) {}
      ```
  avoid_unnecessary_containers:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a widget tree contains an
      instance of `Container` and the only argument to the constructor is
      `child:`.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the invocation of the
      `Container` constructor only has a `child:` argument:

      ```dart
      import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

      Widget buildRow() {
        return [!Container!](
          child: Row(
            children: [
              Text('a'),
              Text('b'),
            ],
          )
        );
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If you intended to provide other arguments to the constructor, then add
      them:

      ```dart
      import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

      Widget buildRow() {
        return Container(
          color: Colors.red.shade100,
          child: Row(
            children: [
              Text('a'),
              Text('b'),
            ],
          )
        );
      }
      ```

      If no other arguments are needed, then unwrap the child widget:

      ```dart
      import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

      Widget buildRow() {
        return Row(
          children: [
            Text('a'),
            Text('b'),
          ],
        );
      }
      ```
  avoid_web_libraries_in_flutter:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a library in a package that
      isn't a web plugin contains an import of a web-only library:
      - `dart:html`
      - `dart:js`
      - `dart:js_util`
      - `dart:js_interop`
      - `dart:js_interop_unsafe`
      - `package:js`
      - `package:web`

      #### Example

      When found in a package that isn't a web plugin, the following code
      produces this diagnostic because it imports `dart:html`:

      ```dart
      import [!'dart:html'!];

      import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

      class C {}
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If the package isn't intended to be a web plugin, then remove the import:

      ```dart
      import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

      class C {}
      ```

      If the package is intended to be a web plugin, then add the following
      lines to the `pubspec.yaml` file of the package:

      ```yaml
      flutter:
        plugin:
          platforms:
            web:
              pluginClass: HelloPlugin
              fileName: hello_web.dart
      ```

      See [Developing packages & plugins](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/developing-packages)
      for more information.
  await_only_futures:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the expression after `await`
      has any type other than `Future<T>`, `FutureOr<T>`, `Future<T>?`,
      `FutureOr<T>?` or `dynamic`.

      An exception is made for the expression `await null` because it is a
      common way to introduce a microtask delay.

      Unless the expression can produce a `Future`, the `await` is unnecessary
      and can cause a reader to assume a level of asynchrony that doesn't exist.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the expression after
      `await` has the type `int`:

      ```dart
      void f() async {
        [!await!] 23;
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Remove the `await`:

      ```dart
      void f() async {
        23;
      }
      ```
  camel_case_extensions:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the name of an extension
      doesn't use the 'UpperCamelCase' naming convention.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the name of the
      extension doesn't start with an uppercase letter:

      ```dart
      extension [!stringExtension!] on String {}
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If the extension needs to have a name (needs to be visible outside this
      library), then rename the extension so that it has a valid name:

      ```dart
      extension StringExtension on String {}
      ```

      If the extension doesn't need to have a name, then remove the name of the
      extension:

      ```dart
      extension on String {}
      ```
  camel_case_types:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the name of a type (a class,
      mixin, enum, or typedef) doesn't use the 'UpperCamelCase' naming
      convention.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the name of the class
      doesn't start with an uppercase letter:

      ```dart
      class [!c!] {}
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Rename the type so that it has a valid name:

      ```dart
      class C {}
      ```
  cancel_subscriptions:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an instance of
      `StreamSubscription` is created but the method `cancel` isn't invoked.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the `subscription`
      isn't canceled:

      ```dart
      import 'dart:async';

      void f(Stream stream) {
        // ignore: unused_local_variable
        var [!subscription = stream.listen((_) {})!];
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Cancel the subscription:

      ```dart
      import 'dart:async';

      void f(Stream stream) {
        var subscription = stream.listen((_) {});
        subscription.cancel();
      }
      ```
  close_sinks:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an instance of `Sink` is
      created but the method `close` isn't invoked.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the `sink` isn't
      closed:

      ```dart
      import 'dart:io';

      void g(File f) {
        var [!sink = f.openWrite()!];
        sink.write('x');
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Close the sink:

      ```dart
      import 'dart:io';

      void g(File f) {
        var sink = f.openWrite();
        sink.write('x');
        sink.close();
      }
      ```
  collection_methods_unrelated_type:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when any one of several methods in
      the core libraries are invoked with arguments of an inappropriate type.
      These methods are ones that don't provide a specific enough type for the
      parameter to allow the normal type checking to catch the error.

      The arguments that are checked are:
      - an argument to `Iterable<E>.contains` should be related to `E`
      - an argument to `List<E>.remove` should be related to `E`
      - an argument to `Map<K, V>.containsKey` should be related to `K`
      - an argument to `Map<K, V>.containsValue` should be related to `V`
      - an argument to `Map<K, V>.remove` should be related to `K`
      - an argument to `Map<K, V>.[]` should be related to `K`
      - an argument to `Queue<E>.remove` should be related to `E`
      - an argument to `Set<E>.lookup` should be related to `E`
      - an argument to `Set<E>.remove` should be related to `E`

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the argument to
      `contains` is a `String`, which isn't assignable to `int`, the element
      type of the list `l`:

      ```dart
      bool f(List<int> l)  => l.contains([!'1'!]);
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If the element type is correct, then change the argument to have the same
      type:

      ```dart
      bool f(List<int> l)  => l.contains(1);
      ```

      If the argument type is correct, then change the element type:

      ```dart
      bool f(List<String> l)  => l.contains('1');
      ```
  constant_identifier_names:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the name of a constant doesn't
      follow the lowerCamelCase naming convention.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the name of the
      top-level variable isn't a lowerCamelCase identifier:

      ```dart
      const [!EMPTY_STRING!] = '';
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Rewrite the name to follow the lowerCamelCase naming convention:

      ```dart
      const emptyString = '';
      ```
  control_flow_in_finally:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a `finally` clause contains a
      `return`, `break`, or `continue` statement.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because there is a `return`
      statement inside a `finally` block:

      ```dart
      int f() {
        try {
          return 1;
        } catch (e) {
          print(e);
        } finally {
          [!return 0;!]
        }
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If the statement isn't needed, then remove the statement, and remove the
      `finally` clause if the block is empty:

      ```dart
      int f() {
        try {
          return 1;
        } catch (e) {
          print(e);
        }
      }
      ```

      If the statement is needed, then move the statement outside the `finally`
      block:

      ```dart
      int f() {
        try {
          return 1;
        } catch (e) {
          print(e);
        }
        return 0;
      }
      ```
  curly_braces_in_flow_control_structures:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a control structure (`if`,
      `for`, `while`, or `do` statement) has a statement other than a block.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the `then` statement
      is not enclosed in a block:

      ```dart
      int f(bool b) {
        if (b)
          [!return 1;!]
        return 0;
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Add braces around the statement that should be a block:

      ```dart
      int f(bool b) {
        if (b) {
          return 1;
        }
        return 0;
      }
      ```
  dangling_library_doc_comments:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a documentation comment that
      appears to be library documentation isn't followed by a `library`
      directive. More specifically, it is produced when a documentation comment
      appears before the first directive in the library, assuming that it isn't
      a `library` directive, or before the first top-level declaration and is
      separated from the declaration by one or more blank lines.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because there's a
      documentation comment before the first `import` directive:

      ```dart
      [!/// This is a great library.!]
      import 'dart:core';
      ```

      The following code produces this diagnostic because there's a
      documentation comment before the first class declaration, but there's a
      blank line between the comment and the declaration.

      ```dart
      [!/// This is a great library.!]

      class C {}
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If the comment is library documentation, then add a `library` directive
      without a name:

      ```dart
      /// This is a great library.
      library;

      import 'dart:core';
      ```

      If the comment is documentation for the following declaration, then remove
      the blank line:

      ```dart
      /// This is a great library.
      class C {}
      ```
  depend_on_referenced_packages:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a package import refers to a
      package that is not specified in the `pubspec.yaml` file.

      Depending explicitly on packages that you reference ensures they will
      always exist and allows you to put a dependency constraint on them to
      guard against breaking changes.

      #### Example

      Given a `pubspec.yaml` file containing the following:

      ```yaml
      dependencies:
        meta: ^3.0.0
      ```

      The following code produces this diagnostic because there is no dependency
      on the package `a`:

      ```dart
      import 'package:a/a.dart';
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Whether the dependency should be a regular dependency or dev dependency
      depends on whether the package is referenced from a public library (one
      under either `lib` or `bin`), or only private libraries, (such as one
      under `test`).

      If the package is referenced from at least one public library, then add a
      regular dependency on the package to the `pubspec.yaml` file under the
      `dependencies` field:

      ```yaml
      dependencies:
        a: ^1.0.0
        meta: ^3.0.0
      ```

      If the package is referenced only from private libraries, then add a
      dev dependency on the package to the `pubspec.yaml` file under the
      `dev_dependencies` field:

      ```yaml
      dependencies:
        meta: ^3.0.0
      dev_dependencies:
        a: ^1.0.0
      ```
  empty_catches:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the block in a `catch` clause
      is empty.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the catch block is
      empty:

      ```dart
      void f() {
        try {
          print('Hello');
        } catch (exception) [!{}!]
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If the exception shouldn't be ignored, then add code to handle the
      exception:

      ```dart
      void f() {
        try {
          print('We can print.');
        } catch (exception) {
          print("We can't print.");
        }
      }
      ```

      If the exception is intended to be ignored, then add a comment explaining
      why:

      ```dart
      void f() {
        try {
          print('We can print.');
        } catch (exception) {
          // Nothing to do.
        }
      }
      ```

      If the exception is intended to be ignored and there isn't any good
      explanation for why, then rename the exception parameter:

      ```dart
      void f() {
        try {
          print('We can print.');
        } catch (_) {}
      }
      ```
  empty_constructor_bodies:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a constructor has an empty
      block body.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the constructor for
      `C` has a block body that is empty:

      ```dart
      class C {
        C() [!{}!]
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Replace the block with a semicolon:

      ```dart
      class C {
        C();
      }
      ```
  empty_statements:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an empty statement is found.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the statement
      controlled by the `while` loop is an empty statement:

      ```dart
      void f(bool condition) {
        while (condition)[!;!]
          g();
      }

      void g() {}
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If there are no statements that need to be controlled, then remove both
      the empty statement and the control structure it's part of (being careful
      that any other code being removed doesn't have a side-effect that needs to
      be preserved):

      ```dart
      void f(bool condition) {
        g();
      }

      void g() {}
      ```

      If there are no statements that need to be controlled but the control
      structure is still required for other reasons, then replace the empty
      statement with a block to make the structure of the code more obvious:

      ```dart
      void f(bool condition) {
        while (condition) {}
        g();
      }

      void g() {}
      ```

      If there are statements that need to be controlled, remove the empty
      statement and adjust the code so that the appropriate statements are being
      controlled, possibly adding a block:

      ```dart
      void f(bool condition) {
        while (condition) {
          g();
        }
      }

      void g() {}
      ```
  file_names:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the name of a `.dart` file
      doesn't use lower_case_with_underscores.

      #### Example

      A file named `SliderMenu.dart` produces this diagnostic because the file
      name uses the UpperCamelCase convention.

      #### Common fixes

      Rename the file to use the lower_case_with_underscores convention, such as
      `slider_menu.dart`.
  hash_and_equals:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a class or mixin either
      overrides the definition of `==` but doesn't override the definition of
      `hashCode`, or conversely overrides the definition of `hashCode` but
      doesn't override the definition of `==`.

      Both the `==` operator and the `hashCode` property of objects must be
      consistent for a common hash map implementation to function properly. As a
      result, when overriding either method, both should be overridden.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the class `C`
      overrides the `==` operator but doesn't override the getter `hashCode`:

      ```dart
      class C {
        final int value;

        C(this.value);

        @override
        bool operator [!==!](Object other) =>
            other is C &&
            other.runtimeType == runtimeType &&
            other.value == value;
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If you need to override one of the members, then add an override of the
      other:

      ```dart
      class C {
        final int value;

        C(this.value);

        @override
        bool operator ==(Object other) =>
            other is C &&
            other.runtimeType == runtimeType &&
            other.value == value;

        @override
        int get hashCode => value.hashCode;
      }
      ```

      If you don't need to override either of the members, then remove the
      unnecessary override:

      ```dart
      class C {
        final int value;

        C(this.value);
      }
      ```
  implementation_imports:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an import references a library
      that's inside the `lib/src` directory of a different package, which
      violates [the convention for pub
      packages](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/package-layout#implementation-files).

      #### Example

      The following code, assuming that it isn't part of the `ffi` package,
      produces this diagnostic because the library being imported is inside the
      top-level `src` directory:

      ```dart
      import [!'package:ffi/src/allocation.dart'!];
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If the library being imported contains code that's part of the public API,
      then import the public library that exports the public API:

      ```dart
      import 'package:ffi/ffi.dart';
      ```

      If the library being imported isn't part of the public API of the package,
      then either find a different way to accomplish your goal, assuming that
      it's possible, or open an issue asking the package authors to make it part
      of the public API.
  implicit_call_tearoffs:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an object with a `call` method
      is assigned to a function-typed variable, implicitly tearing off the
      `call` method.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because an instance of
      `Callable` is passed to a function expecting a `Function`:

      ```dart
      class Callable {
        void call() {}
      }

      void callIt(void Function() f) {
        f();
      }

      void f() {
        callIt([!Callable()!]);
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Explicitly tear off the `call` method:

      ```dart
      class Callable {
        void call() {}
      }

      void callIt(void Function() f) {
        f();
      }

      void f() {
        callIt(Callable().call);
      }
      ```
  library_names:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the name of a library doesn't
      use the lower_case_with_underscores naming convention.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the library name
      `libraryName` isn't a lower_case_with_underscores identifier:

      ```dart
      library [!libraryName!];
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If the library name is not required, then remove the library name:

      ```dart
      library;
      ```

      If the library name is required, then convert it to use the
      lower_case_with_underscores naming convention:

      ```dart
      library library_name;
      ```
  library_prefixes:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an import prefix doesn't use
      the lower_case_with_underscores naming convention.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the prefix
      `ffiSupport` isn't a lower_case_with_underscores identifier:

      ```dart
      import 'package:ffi/ffi.dart' as [!ffiSupport!];
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Convert the prefix to use the lower_case_with_underscores naming
      convention:

      ```dart
      import 'package:ffi/ffi.dart' as ffi_support;
      ```
  library_private_types_in_public_api:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a type that is not part of the
      public API of a library is referenced in the public API of that library.

      Using a private type in a public API can make the API unusable outside the
      defining library.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the parameter `c` of
      the public function `f` has a type that is library private (`_C`):

      ```dart
      void f([!_C!] c) {}

      class _C {}
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If the API doesn't need to be used outside the defining library, then make
      it private:

      ```dart
      void _f(_C c) {}

      class _C {}
      ```

      If the API needs to be part of the public API of the library, then either
      use a different type that's public, or make the referenced type public:

      ```dart
      void f(C c) {}

      class C {}
      ```
  literal_only_boolean_expressions:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the value of the condition in
      an `if` or loop statement is known to be either always `true` or always
      `false`. An exception is made for a `while` loop whose condition is the
      Boolean literal `true`.

      #### Examples

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the condition will
      always evaluate to `true`:

      ```dart
      void f() {
        [!if (true) {
          print('true');
        }!]
      }
      ```

      The lint will evaluate a subset of expressions that are composed of
      constants, so the following code will also produce this diagnostic because
      the condition will always evaluate to `false`:

      ```dart
      void g(int i) {
        [!if (1 == 0 || 3 > 4) {
          print('false');
        }!]
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If the condition is wrong, then correct the condition so that it's value
      can't be known at compile time:

      ```dart
      void g(int i) {
        if (i == 0 || i > 4) {
          print('false');
        }
      }
      ```

      If the condition is correct, then simplify the code to not evaluate the
      condition:

      ```dart
      void f() {
        print('true');
      }
      ```
  no_adjacent_strings_in_list:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when two string literals are
      adjacent in a list literal. Adjacent strings in Dart are concatenated
      together to form a single string, but the intent might be for each string
      to be a separate element in the list.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the strings `'a'` and
      `'b'` are adjacent:

      ```dart
      List<String> list = [[!'a' 'b'!], 'c'];
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If the two strings are intended to be separate elements of the list, then
      add a comma between them:

      ```dart
      List<String> list = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
      ```

      If the two strings are intended to be a single concatenated string, then
      either manually merge the strings:

      ```dart
      List<String> list = ['ab', 'c'];
      ```

      Or use the `+` operator to concatenate the strings:

      ```dart
      List<String> list = ['a' + 'b', 'c'];
      ```
  no_duplicate_case_values:

      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when two or more `case` clauses in
      the same `switch` statement have the same value.

      Any `case` clauses after the first can't be executed, so having duplicate
      `case` clauses is misleading.

      This diagnostic is often the result of either a typo or a change to the
      value of a constant.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because two case clauses have
      the same value (1):

      ```dart
      // @dart = 2.14
      void f(int v) {
        switch (v) {
          case 1:
            break;
          case [!1!]:
            break;
        }
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If one of the clauses should have a different value, then change the value
      of the clause:

      ```dart
      void f(int v) {
        switch (v) {
          case 1:
            break;
          case 2:
            break;
        }
      }
      ```

      If the value is correct, then merge the statements into a single clause:

      ```dart
      void f(int v) {
        switch (v) {
          case 1:
            break;
        }
      }
      ```
  no_leading_underscores_for_library_prefixes:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the name of a prefix declared
      on an import starts with an underscore.

      Library prefixes are inherently not visible outside the declaring library,
      so a leading underscore indicating private adds no value.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the prefix `_core`
      starts with an underscore:

      ```dart
      import 'dart:core' as [!_core!];
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Remove the underscore:

      ```dart
      import 'dart:core' as core;
      ```
  no_leading_underscores_for_local_identifiers:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the name of a local variable
      starts with an underscore.

      Local variables are inherently not visible outside the declaring library,
      so a leading underscore indicating private adds no value.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the parameter `_s`
      starts with an underscore:

      ```dart
      int f(String [!_s!]) => _s.length;
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Remove the underscore:

      ```dart
      int f(String s) => s.length;
      ```
  no_logic_in_create_state:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an implementation of
      `createState` in a subclass of `StatefulWidget` contains any logic other
      than the return of the result of invoking a zero argument constructor.

      #### Examples

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the constructor
      invocation has arguments:

      ```dart
      import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

      class MyWidget extends StatefulWidget {
        @override
        MyState createState() => [!MyState(0)!];
      }

      class MyState extends State {
        int x;

        MyState(this.x);
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Rewrite the code so that `createState` doesn't contain any logic:

      ```dart
      import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

      class MyWidget extends StatefulWidget {
        @override
        MyState createState() => MyState();
      }

      class MyState extends State {
        int x = 0;

        MyState();
      }
      ```
  no_wildcard_variable_uses:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when either a parameter or local
      variable whose name consists of only underscores is referenced. Such
      names will become non-binding in a future version of the Dart language,
      making the reference illegal.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the name of the
      parameter consists of two underscores:

      ```dart
      void f(int __) {
        print([!__!]);
      }
      ```

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the name of the
      local variable consists of a single underscore:

      ```dart
      void f() {
        int _ = 0;
        print([!_!]);
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If the variable or parameter is intended to be referenced, then give it a
      name that has at least one non-underscore character:

      ```dart
      void f(int p) {
        print(p);
      }
      ```

      If the variable or parameter is not intended to be referenced, then
      replace the reference with a different expression:

      ```dart
      void f() {
        print(0);
      }
      ```
  non_constant_identifier_names:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the name of a class member,
      top-level declaration, variable, parameter, named parameter, or named
      constructor that isn't declared to be `const`, doesn't use the
      lowerCamelCase convention.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the top-level variable
      `Count` doesn't start with a lowercase letter:

      ```dart
      var [!Count!] = 0;
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Change the name in the declaration to follow the lowerCamelCase
      convention:

      ```dart
      var count = 0;
      ```
  null_check_on_nullable_type_parameter:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a null check operator is used
      on a variable whose type is `T?`, where `T` is a type parameter that
      allows the type argument to be nullable (either has no bound or has a
      bound that is nullable).

      Given a generic type parameter `T` which has a nullable bound, it is very
      easy to introduce erroneous null checks when working with a variable of
      type `T?`. Specifically, it is not uncommon to have `T? x;` and want to
      assert that `x` has been set to a valid value of type `T`. A common
      mistake is to do so using `x!`. This is almost always incorrect, because
      if `T` is a nullable type, `x` may validly hold `null` as a value of type
      `T`.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because `t` has the type `T?`
      and `T` allows the type argument to be nullable (because it has no
      `extends` clause):

      ```dart
      T f<T>(T? t) => t[!!!];
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Use the type parameter to cast the variable:

      ```dart
      T f<T>(T? t) => t as T;
      ```
  overridden_fields:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a class defines a field that
      overrides a field from a superclass.

      Overriding a field with another field causes the object to have two
      distinct fields, but because the fields have the same name only one of the
      fields can be referenced in a given scope. That can lead to confusion
      where a reference to one of the fields can be mistaken for a reference to
      the other.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the field `f` in `B`
      shadows the field `f` in `A`:

      ```dart
      class A {
        int f = 1;
      }

      class B extends A {
        @override
        int [!f!] = 2;
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If the two fields are representing the same property, then remove the
      field from the subclass:

      ```dart
      class A {
        int f = 1;
      }

      class B extends A {}
      ```

      If the two fields should be distinct, then rename one of the fields:

      ```dart
      class A {
        int f = 1;
      }

      class B extends A {
        int g = 2;
      }
      ```

      If the two fields are related in some way, but can't be the same, then
      find a different way to implement the semantics you need.
  package_names:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the name of a package doesn't
      use the lower_case_with_underscores naming convention.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the name of the
      package uses the lowerCamelCase naming convention:

      ```yaml
      name: [!somePackage!]
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Rewrite the name of the package using the lower_case_with_underscores
      naming convention:

      ```yaml
      name: some_package
      ```
  package_prefixed_library_names:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a library has a name that
      doesn't follow these guidelines:

      - Prefix all library names with the package name.
      - Make the entry library have the same name as the package.
      - For all other libraries in a package, after the package name add the
        dot-separated path to the library's Dart file.
      - For libraries under `lib`, omit the top directory name.

      For example, given a package named `my_package`, here are the library
      names for various files in the package:

      ```dart
      // In lib/my_package.dart
      library my_package;

      // In lib/other.dart
      library my_package.other;

      // In lib/foo/bar.dart
      library my_package.foo.bar;

      // In example/foo/bar.dart
      library my_package.example.foo.bar;

      // In lib/src/private.dart
      library my_package.src.private;
      ```

      #### Example

      Assuming that the file containing the following code is not in a file
      named `special.dart` in the `lib` directory of a package named `something`
      (which would be an exception to the rule), the analyzer produces this
      diagnostic because the name of the library doesn't conform to the
      guidelines above:

      ```dart
      library [!something.special!];
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Change the name of the library to conform to the guidelines.
  prefer_adjacent_string_concatenation:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the `+` operator is used to
      concatenate two string literals.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because two string literals
      are being concatenated by using the `+` operator:

      ```dart
      var s = 'a' [!+!] 'b';
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Remove the operator:

      ```dart
      var s = 'a' 'b';
      ```
  prefer_collection_literals:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a constructor is used to create
      a list, map, or set, but a literal would produce the same result.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the constructor for
      `Map` is being used to create a map that could also be created using a
      literal:

      ```dart
      var m = [!Map<String, String>()!];
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Use the literal representation:

      ```dart
      var m = <String, String>{};
      ```
  prefer_conditional_assignment:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an assignment to a variable is
      conditional based on whether the variable has the value `null` and the
      `??=` operator could be used instead.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the parameter `s` is
      being compared to `null` in order to determine whether to assign a
      different value:

      ```dart
      int f(String? s) {
        [!if (s == null) {
          s = '';
        }!]
        return s.length;
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Use the `??=` operator instead of an explicit `if` statement:

      ```dart
      int f(String? s) {
        s ??= '';
        return s.length;
      }
      ```
  prefer_const_constructors:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an invocation of a const
      constructor isn't either preceded by `const` or in a [constant context][].

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the invocation of the
      `const` constructor is neither prefixed by `const` nor in a
      [constant context][]:

      ```dart
      class C {
        const C();
      }

      C c = [!C()!];
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If the context can be made a [constant context][], then do so:

      ```dart
      class C {
        const C();
      }

      const C c = C();
      ```

      If the context can't be made a [constant context][], then add `const`
      before the constructor invocation:

      ```dart
      class C {
        const C();
      }

      C c = const C();
      ```
  prefer_const_constructors_in_immutables:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a non-`const` constructor is
      found in a class that has the `@immutable` annotation.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the constructor in `C`
      isn't declared as `const` even though `C` has the `@immutable` annotation:

      ```dart
      import 'package:meta/meta.dart';

      @immutable
      class C {
        final f;

        [!C!](this.f);
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If the class really is intended to be immutable, then add the `const`
      modifier to the constructor:

      ```dart
      import 'package:meta/meta.dart';

      @immutable
      class C {
        final f;

        const C(this.f);
      }
      ```

      If the class is mutable, then remove the `@immutable` annotation:

      ```dart
      class C {
        final f;

        C(this.f);
      }
      ```
  prefer_const_declarations:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a top-level variable, static
      field, or local variable is marked as `final` and is initialized to a
      constant value.

      #### Examples

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the top-level variable
      `v` is both `final` and initialized to a constant value:

      ```dart
      [!final v = const <int>[]!];
      ```

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the static field `f`
      is both `final` and initialized to a constant value:

      ```dart
      class C {
        static [!final f = const <int>[]!];
      }
      ```

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the local variable `v`
      is both `final` and initialized to a constant value:

      ```dart
      void f() {
        [!final v = const <int>[]!];
        print(v);
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Replace the keyword `final` with `const` and remove `const` from the
      initializer:

      ```dart
      class C {
        static const f = <int>[];
      }
      ```
  prefer_const_literals_to_create_immutables:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a non-const list, map, or set
      literal is passed as an argument to a constructor declared in a class
      annotated with `@immutable`.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the list literal
      (`[1]`) is being passed to a constructor in an immutable class but isn't
      a constant list:

      ```dart
      import 'package:meta/meta.dart';

      @immutable
      class C {
        final f;

        const C(this.f);
      }

      C c = C([![1]!]);
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If the context can be made a [constant context][], then do so:

      ```dart
      import 'package:meta/meta.dart';

      @immutable
      class C {
        final f;

        const C(this.f);
      }

      const C c = C([1]);
      ```

      If the context can't be made a [constant context][] but the constructor
      can be invoked using `const`, then add `const` before the constructor
      invocation:

      ```dart
      import 'package:meta/meta.dart';

      @immutable
      class C {
        final f;

        const C(this.f);
      }

      C c = const C([1]);
      ```

      If the context can't be made a [constant context][] and the constructor
      can't be invoked using `const`, then add the keyword `const` before the
      collection literal:

      ```dart
      import 'package:meta/meta.dart';

      @immutable
      class C {
        final f;

        const C(this.f);
      }

      C c = C(const [1]);
      ```
  prefer_contains:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the method `indexOf` is used and
      the result is only compared with `-1` or `0` in a way where the semantics
      are equivalent to using `contains`.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the condition in the
      `if` statement is checking to see whether the list contains the string:

      ```dart
      void f(List<String> l, String s) {
        if ([!l.indexOf(s) < 0!]) {
          // ...
        }
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Use `contains` instead, negating the condition when necessary:

      ```dart
      void f(List<String> l, String s) {
        if (l.contains(s)) {
          // ...
        }
      }
      ```
  prefer_final_fields:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a private field is only
      assigned one time. The field can be initialized in multiple constructors
      and still be flagged because only one of those constructors can ever run.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the field `_f` is only
      assigned one time, in the field's initializer:

      ```dart
      class C {
        int [!_f = 1!];

        int get f => _f;
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Mark the field `final`:

      ```dart
      class C {
        final int _f = 1;

        int get f => _f;
      }
      ```
  prefer_for_elements_to_map_fromIterable:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when `Map.fromIterable` is used to
      build a map that could be built using the `for` element.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because `fromIterable` is
      being used to build a map that could be built using a `for` element:

      ```dart
      void f(Iterable<String> data) {
        [!Map<String, int>.fromIterable(
          data,
          key: (element) => element,
          value: (element) => element.length,
        )!];
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Use a `for` element to build the map:

      ```dart
      void f(Iterable<String> data) {
        <String, int>{
          for (var element in data)
            element: element.length
        };
      }
      ```
  prefer_function_declarations_over_variables:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a closure is assigned to a
      local variable and the local variable is not re-assigned anywhere.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the local variable `f`
      is initialized to be a closure and isn't assigned any other value:

      ```dart
      void g() {
        var [!f = (int i) => i * 2!];
        f(1);
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Replace the local variable with a local function:

      ```dart
      void g() {
        int f(int i) => i * 2;
        f(1);
      }
      ```
  prefer_generic_function_type_aliases:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a typedef is written using the
      older syntax for function type aliases in which the name being declared is
      embedded in the function type.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because it uses the older
      syntax:

      ```dart
      typedef void [!F!]<T>();
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Rewrite the typedef to use the newer syntax:

      ```dart
      typedef F<T> = void Function();
      ```
  prefer_if_null_operators:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a conditional expression (using
      the `?:` operator) is used to select a different value when a local
      variable is `null`.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the variable `s` is
      being compared to `null` so that a different value can be returned when
      `s` is `null`:

      ```dart
      String f(String? s) => [!s == null ? '' : s!];
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Use the if-null operator instead:

      ```dart
      String f(String? s) => s ?? '';
      ```
  prefer_initializing_formals:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a constructor parameter is used
      to initialize a field without modification.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the parameter `c` is
      only used to set the field `c`:

      ```dart
      class C {
        int c;

        C(int c) : [!this.c = c!];
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Use an initializing formal parameter to initialize the field:

      ```dart
      class C {
        int c;

        C(this.c);
      }
      ```
  prefer_inlined_adds:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the methods `add` and `addAll`
      are invoked on a list literal where the elements being added could be
      included in the list literal.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the `add` method is
      being used to add `b`, when it could have been included directly in the
      list literal:

      ```dart
      List<String> f(String a, String b) {
        return [a]..[!add!](b);
      }
      ```

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the `addAll` method is
      being used to add the elements of `b`, when it could have been included
      directly in the list literal:

      ```dart
      List<String> f(String a, List<String> b) {
        return [a]..[!addAll!](b);
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If the `add` method is being used, then make the argument an element of
      the list and remove the invocation:

      ```dart
      List<String> f(String a, String b) {
        return [a, b];
      }
      ```

      If the `addAll` method is being used, then use the spread operator on the
      argument to add its elements to the list and remove the invocation:

      ```dart
      List<String> f(String a, List<String> b) {
        return [a, ...b];
      }
      ```
  prefer_interpolation_to_compose_strings:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when string literals and computed
      strings are being concatenated using the `+` operator, but string
      interpolation would achieve the same result.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the elements of the
      list `l` are being concatenated with other strings using the `+` operator:

      ```dart
      String f(List<String> l) {
        return [!'(' + l[0] + ', ' + l[1] + ')'!];
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Use string interpolation:

      ```dart
      String f(List<String> l) {
        return '(${l[0]}, ${l[1]})';
      }
      ```
  prefer_is_empty:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the result of invoking either
      `Iterable.length` or `Map.length` is compared for equality with zero
      (`0`).

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the result of invoking
      `length` is checked for equality with zero:

      ```dart
      int f(Iterable<int> p) => [!p.length == 0!] ? 0 : p.first;
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Replace the use of `length` with a use of either `isEmpty` or
      `isNotEmpty`:

      ```dart
      void f(Iterable<int> p) => p.isEmpty ? 0 : p.first;
      ```
  prefer_is_not_empty:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the result of invoking
      `Iterable.isEmpty` or `Map.isEmpty` is negated.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the result of invoking
      `Iterable.isEmpty` is negated:

      ```dart
      void f(Iterable<int> p) => [!!p.isEmpty!] ? p.first : 0;
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Rewrite the code to use `isNotEmpty`:

      ```dart
      void f(Iterable<int> p) => p.isNotEmpty ? p.first : 0;
      ```
  prefer_is_not_operator:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the prefix `!` operator is used
      to negate the result of an `is` test.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the result of testing
      to see whether `o` is a `String` is negated using the prefix `!` operator:

      ```dart
      String f(Object o) {
        if ([!!(o is String)!]) {
          return o.toString();
        }
        return o;
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Use the `is!` operator instead:

      ```dart
      String f(Object o) {
        if (o is! String) {
          return o.toString();
        }
        return o;
      }
      ```
  prefer_iterable_whereType:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the method `Iterable.where` is
      being used to filter elements based on their type.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the method `where` is
      being used to access only the strings within the iterable:

      ```dart
      Iterable<Object> f(Iterable<Object> p) => p.[!where!]((e) => e is String);
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Rewrite the code to use `whereType`:

      ```dart
      Iterable<String> f(Iterable<Object> p) => p.whereType<String>();
      ```

      This might also allow you to tighten the types in your code or remove
      other type checks.
  prefer_null_aware_operators:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a comparison with `null` is
      used to guard a member reference, and `null` is used as a result when the
      guarded target is `null`.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the invocation of
      `length` is guarded by a `null` comparison even though the default value
      is `null`:

      ```dart
      int? f(List<int>? p) {
        return [!p == null ? null : p.length!];
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Use a null-aware access operator instead:

      ```dart
      int? f(List<int>? p) {
        return p?.length;
      }
      ```
  prefer_relative_imports:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an `import` in a library inside
      the `lib` directory uses a `package:` URI to refer to another library in
      the same package.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because it uses a `package:`
      URI when a relative URI could have been used:

      ```dart
      import 'package:my_package/bar.dart';
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Use a relative URI to import the library:

      ```dart
      import 'bar.dart';
      ```
  prefer_typing_uninitialized_variables:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a variable without an
      initializer doesn't have an explicit type annotation.

      Without either a type annotation or an initializer, a variable has the
      type `dynamic`, which allows any value to be assigned to the variable,
      often causing hard to identify bugs.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the variable `r`
      doesn't have either a type annotation or an initializer:

      ```dart
      Object f() {
        var [!r!];
        r = '';
        return r;
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If the variable can be initialized, then add an initializer:

      ```dart
      Object f() {
        var r = '';
        return r;
      }
      ```

      If the variable can't be initialized, then add an explicit type
      annotation:

      ```dart
      Object f() {
        String r;
        r = '';
        return r;
      }
      ```
  prefer_void_to_null:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when `Null` is used in a location
      where `void` would be a valid choice.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the function `f` is
      declared to return `null` (at some future time):

      ```dart
      Future<[!Null!]> f() async {}
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Replace the use of `Null` with a use of `void`:

      ```dart
      Future<void> f() async {}
      ```
  provide_deprecation_message:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a `deprecated` annotation is
      used instead of the `Deprecated` annotation.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the function `f` is
      annotated with `deprecated`:

      ```dart
      [!@deprecated!]
      void f() {}
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Convert the code to use the longer form:

      ```dart
      @Deprecated('Use g instead. Will be removed in 4.0.0.')
      void f() {}
      ```
  recursive_getters:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a getter invokes itself,
      resulting in an infinite loop.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the getter `count`
      invokes itself:

      ```dart
      class C {
        int _count = 0;

        int get [!count!] => count;
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Change the getter to not invoke itself:

      ```dart
      class C {
        int _count = 0;

        int get count => _count;
      }
      ```
  secure_pubspec_urls:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a URL in a `pubspec.yaml` file is
      using a non-secure scheme, such as `http`.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the `pubspec.yaml` file
      contains an `http` URL:

      ```yaml
      dependencies:
        example: any
          repository: [!http://github.com/dart-lang/example!]
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Change the scheme of the URL to use a secure scheme, such as `https`:

      ```yaml
      dependencies:
        example: any
          repository: https://github.com/dart-lang/example
      ```
  sized_box_for_whitespace:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a `Container` is created using
      only the `height` and/or `width` arguments.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the `Container` has
      only the `width` argument:

      ```dart
      import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

      Widget buildRow() {
        return Row(
          children: <Widget>[
            const Text('...'),
            [!Container!](
              width: 4,
              child: Text('...'),
            ),
            const Expanded(
              child: Text('...'),
            ),
          ],
        );
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Replace the `Container` with a `SizedBox` of the same dimensions:

      ```dart
      import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

      Widget buildRow() {
        return Row(
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('...'),
            SizedBox(
              width: 4,
              child: Text('...'),
            ),
            Expanded(
              child: Text('...'),
            ),
          ],
        );
      }
      ```
  slash_for_doc_comments:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a documentation comment uses
      the block comment style (delimited by `/**` and `*/`).

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the documentation
      comment for `f` uses a block comment style:

      ```dart
      [!/**
       * Example.
       */!]
      void f() {}
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Use an end-of-line comment style:

      ```dart
      /// Example.
      void f() {}
      ```
  sort_child_properties_last:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the `child` or `children`
      argument isn't the last argument in an invocation of a widget class'
      constructor. An exception is made if all of the arguments after the
      `child` or `children` argument are function expressions.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the `child` argument
      isn't the last argument in the invocation of the `Center` constructor:

      ```dart
      import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

      Widget createWidget() {
        return Center(
          [!child: Text('...')!],
          widthFactor: 0.5,
        );
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Move the `child` or `children` argument to be last:

      ```dart
      import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

      Widget createWidget() {
        return Center(
          widthFactor: 0.5,
          child: Text('...'),
        );
      }
      ```
  sort_pub_dependencies:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the keys in a dependency map in
      the `pubspec.yaml` file aren't sorted alphabetically. The dependency maps
      that are checked are the `dependencies`, `dev_dependencies`, and
      `dependency_overrides` maps.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the entries in the
      `dependencies` map are not sorted:

      ```yaml
      dependencies:
        path: any
        collection: any
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Sort the entries:

      ```yaml
      dependencies:
        collection: any
        path: any
      ```
  test_types_in_equals:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an override of the `==`
      operator doesn't include a type test on the value of the parameter.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because `other` is not type
      tested:

      ```dart
      class C {
        final int f;

        C(this.f);

        @override
        bool operator ==(Object other) {
          return ([!other as C!]).f == f;
        }
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Perform an `is` test as part of computing the return value:

      ```dart
      class C {
        final int f;

        C(this.f);

        @override
        bool operator ==(Object other) {
          return other is C && other.f == f;
        }
      }
      ```
  throw_in_finally:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a `throw` statement is found
      inside a `finally` block.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because there is a `throw`
      statement inside a `finally` block:

      ```dart
      void f() {
        try {
          // ...
        } catch (e) {
          // ...
        } finally {
          [!throw 'error'!];
        }
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Rewrite the code so that the `throw` statement isn't inside a `finally`
      block:

      ```dart
      void f() {
        try {
          // ...
        } catch (e) {
          // ...
        }
        throw 'error';
      }
      ```
  type_init_formals:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an initializing formal
      parameter (`this.x`) or a super parameter (`super.x`) has an explicit type
      annotation that is the same as the field or overridden parameter.

      If a constructor parameter is using `this.x` to initialize a field, then
      the type of the parameter is implicitly the same type as the field. If a
      constructor parameter is using `super.x` to forward to a super
      constructor, then the type of the parameter is implicitly the same as the
      super constructor parameter.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the parameter `this.c`
      has an explicit type that is the same as the field `c`:

      ```dart
      class C {
        int c;

        C([!int!] this.c);
      }
      ```

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the parameter
      `super.a` has an explicit type that is the same as the parameter `a` from
      the superclass:

      ```dart
      class A {
        A(int a);
      }

      class B extends A {
        B([!int!] super.a);
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Remove the type annotation from the parameter:

      ```dart
      class C {
        int c;

        C(this.c);
      }
      ```
  type_literal_in_constant_pattern:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a type literal appears as a
      pattern.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because a type literal is used
      as a constant pattern:

      ```dart
      void f(Object? x) {
        if (x case [!num!]) {
          // ...
        }
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If the type literal is intended to match an object of the given type, then
      use either a variable pattern:

      ```dart
      void f(Object? x) {
        if (x case num _) {
          // ...
        }
      }
      ```

      Or an object pattern:

      ```dart
      void f(Object? x) {
        if (x case num()) {
          // ...
        }
      }
      ```

      If the type literal is intended to match the type literal, then write it
      as a constant pattern:

      ```dart
      void f(Object? x) {
        if (x case const (num)) {
          // ...
        }
      }
      ```
  unnecessary_brace_in_string_interps:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a string interpolation with
      braces is used to interpolate a simple identifier and isn't followed by
      alphanumeric text.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the interpolation
      element `${s}` uses braces when they are not necessary:

      ```dart
      String f(String s) {
        return '"[!${s}!]"';
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Remove the unnecessary braces:

      ```dart
      String f(String s) {
        return '"$s"';
      }
      ```
  unnecessary_const:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the keyword `const` is used in
      a [constant context][]. The keyword isn't required because it's implied.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the keyword `const` in
      the list literal isn't needed:

      ```dart
      const l = [!const!] <int>[];
      ```

      The list is implicitly `const` because of the keyword `const` on the
      variable declaration.

      #### Common fixes

      Remove the unnecessary keyword:

      ```dart
      const l = <int>[];
      ```
  unnecessary_constructor_name:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a reference to an unnamed
      constructor uses `.new`. The only place where `.new` is required is in a
      constructor tear-off.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because `.new` is being used
      to refer to the unnamed constructor where it isn't required:

      ```dart
      var o = Object.[!new!]();
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Remove the unnecessary `.new`:

      ```dart
      var o = Object();
      ```
  unnecessary_getters_setters:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a getter and setter pair
      returns and sets the value of a field without any additional processing.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the getter/setter pair
      named `c` only expose the field named `_c`:

      ```dart
      class C {
        int? _c;

        int? get [!c!] => _c;

        set c(int? v) => _c = v;
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Make the field public and remove the getter and setter:

      ```dart
      class C {
        int? c;
      }
      ```
  unnecessary_late:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a top-level variable or static
      field with an initializer is marked as `late`. Top-level variables and
      static fields are implicitly late, so they don't need to be explicitly
      marked.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the static field `c`
      has the modifier `late` even though it has an initializer:

      ```dart
      class C {
        static [!late!] String c = '';
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Remove the keyword `late`:

      ```dart
      class C {
        static String c = '';
      }
      ```
  unnecessary_new:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the keyword `new` is used to
      invoke a constructor.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the keyword `new` is
      used to invoke the unnamed constructor from `Object`:

      ```dart
      var o = [!new!] Object();
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Remove the keyword `new`:

      ```dart
      var o = Object();
      ```
  unnecessary_null_aware_assignments:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the right-hand side of a
      null-aware assignment is the `null` literal.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the null aware
      operator is being used to assign `null` to `s` when `s` is already `null`:

      ```dart
      void f(String? s) {
        [!s ??= null!];
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If a non-null value should be assigned to the left-hand operand, then
      change the right-hand side:

      ```dart
      void f(String? s) {
        s ??= '';
      }
      ```

      If there is no non-null value to assign to the left-hand operand, then
      remove the assignment:

      ```dart
      void f(String? s) {
      }
      ```
  unnecessary_null_in_if_null_operators:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the right operand of the `??`
      operator is the literal `null`.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the right-hand operand
      of the `??` operator is `null`:

      ```dart
      String? f(String? s) => s ?? [!null!];
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If a non-null value should be used for the right-hand operand, then
      change the right-hand side:

      ```dart
      String f(String? s) => s ?? '';
      ```

      If there is no non-null value to use for the right-hand operand, then
      remove the operator and the right-hand operand:

      ```dart
      String? f(String? s) => s;
      ```
  unnecessary_nullable_for_final_variable_declarations:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a final field or variable has a
      nullable type but is initialized to a non-nullable value.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the final variable `i`
      has a nullable type (`int?`), but can never be `null`:

      ```dart
      final int? [!i!] = 1;
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Make the type non-nullable:

      ```dart
      final int i = 1;
      ```
  unnecessary_overrides:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an instance member overrides an
      inherited member but only invokes the overridden member with exactly the
      same arguments.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the method `D.m`
      doesn't do anything other than invoke the overridden method:

      ```dart
      class C {
        int m(int x) => x;
      }

      class D extends C {
        @override
        int [!m!](int x) => super.m(x);
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If the method should do something more than what the overridden method
      does, then implement the missing functionality:

      ```dart
      class C {
        int m(int x) => x;
      }

      class D extends C {
        @override
        int m(int x) => super.m(x) + 1;
      }
      ```

      If the overridden method should be modified by changing the return type or
      one or more of the parameter types, making one of the parameters
      `covariant`, having a documentation comment, or by having additional
      annotations, then update the code:

      ```dart
      import 'package:meta/meta.dart';

      class C {
        int m(int x) => x;
      }

      class D extends C {
        @mustCallSuper
        @override
        int m(int x) => super.m(x);
      }
      ```

      If the overriding method doesn't change or enhance the semantics of the
      code, then remove it:

      ```dart
      class C {
        int m(int x) => x;
      }

      class D extends C {}
      ```
  unnecessary_statements:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an expression statement has no
      clear effect.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the addition of the
      returned values from the two invocations has no clear effect:

      ```dart
      void f(int Function() first, int Function() second) {
        [!first() + second()!];
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If the expression doesn't need to be computed, then remove it:

      ```dart
      void f(int Function() first, int Function() second) {
      }
      ```

      If the value of the expression is needed, then make use of it, possibly
      assigning it to a local variable first:

      ```dart
      void f(int Function() first, int Function() second) {
        print(first() + second());
      }
      ```

      If portions of the expression need to be executed, then remove the
      unnecessary portions:

      ```dart
      void f(int Function() first, int Function() second) {
        first();
        second();
      }
      ```
  unnecessary_string_escapes:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when characters in a string are
      escaped when escaping them is unnecessary.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because single quotes don't
      need to be escaped inside strings delimited by double quotes:

      ```dart
      var s = "Don[!\!]'t use a backslash here.";
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Remove the unnecessary backslashes:

      ```dart
      var s = "Don't use a backslash here.";
      ```
  unnecessary_string_interpolations:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a string literal contains a
      single interpolation of a `String`-valued variable and no other
      characters.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the string literal
      contains a single interpolation and doesn't contain any character outside
      the interpolation:

      ```dart
      String f(String s) => [!'$s'!];
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Replace the string literal with the content of the interpolation:

      ```dart
      String f(String s) => s;
      ```
  unnecessary_this:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the keyword `this` is used to
      access a member that isn't shadowed.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the use of `this` to
      access the field `_f` isn't necessary:

      ```dart
      class C {
        int _f = 2;

        int get f => [!this!]._f;
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Remove the `this.`:

      ```dart
      class C {
        int _f = 2;

        int get f => _f;
      }
      ```
  unnecessary_to_list_in_spreads:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when `toList` is used to convert an
      `Iterable` to a `List` just before a spread operator is applied to the
      list. The spread operator can be applied to any `Iterable`, so the
      conversion isn't necessary.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because `toList` is invoked on
      the result of `map`, which is an `Iterable` that the spread operator could
      be applied to directly:

      ```dart
      List<String> toLowercase(List<String> strings) {
        return [
          ...strings.map((String s) => s.toLowerCase()).[!toList!](),
        ];
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Remove the invocation of `toList`:

      ```dart
      List<String> toLowercase(List<String> strings) {
        return [
          ...strings.map((String s) => s.toLowerCase()),
        ];
      }
      ```
  unrelated_type_equality_checks:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when two objects are being compared
      and neither of the static types of the two objects is a subtype of the
      other.

      Such a comparison will usually return `false` and might not reflect the
      programmer's intent.

      There can be false positives. For example, a class named `Point` might
      have subclasses named `CartesianPoint` and `PolarPoint`, neither of which
      is a subtype of the other, but it might still be appropriate to test the
      equality of instances.

      As a concrete case, the classes `Int64` and `Int32` from `package:fixnum`
      allow comparing instances to an `int` provided the `int` is on the
      right-hand side. This case is specifically allowed by the diagnostic, but
      other such cases are not.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the string `s` is
      being compared to the integer `1`:

      ```dart
      bool f(String s) {
        return s [!==!] 1;
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Replace one of the operands with something compatible with the other
      operand:

      ```dart
      bool f(String s) {
        return s.length == 1;
      }
      ```
  use_build_context_synchronously:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a `BuildContext` is referenced
      by a `StatefulWidget` after an asynchronous gap without first checking the
      `mounted` property.

      Storing a `BuildContext` for later use can lead to difficult to diagnose
      crashes. Asynchronous gaps implicitly store a `BuildContext`, making them
      easy to overlook for diagnosis.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the `context` is
      passed to a constructor after the `await`:

      ```dart
      import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

      class MyWidget extends Widget {
        void onButtonTapped(BuildContext context) async {
          await Future.delayed(const Duration(seconds: 1));
          Navigator.of([!context!]).pop();
        }
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If you can remove the asynchronous gap, do so:

      ```dart
      import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

      class MyWidget extends Widget {
        void onButtonTapped(BuildContext context) {
          Navigator.of(context).pop();
        }
      }
      ```

      If you can't remove the asynchronous gap, then use `mounted` to guard the
      use of the `context`:

      ```dart
      import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

      class MyWidget extends Widget {
        void onButtonTapped(BuildContext context) async {
          await Future.delayed(const Duration(seconds: 1));
          if (context.mounted) {
            Navigator.of(context).pop();
          }
        }
      }
      ```
  use_full_hex_values_for_flutter_colors:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the argument to the constructor
      of the `Color` class is a literal integer that isn't represented as an
      8-digit hexadecimal integer.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the argument (`1`)
      isn't represented as an 8-digit hexadecimal integer:

      ```dart
      import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

      Color c = Color([!1!]);
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Convert the representation to be an 8-digit hexadecimal integer:

      ```dart
      import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

      Color c = Color(0x00000001);
      ```
  use_function_type_syntax_for_parameters:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the older style function-valued
      parameter syntax is used.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the function-valued
      parameter `f` is declared using an older style syntax:

      ```dart
      void g([!bool f(String s)!]) {}
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Use the generic function type syntax to declare the parameter:

      ```dart
      void g(bool Function(String) f) {}
      ```
  use_key_in_widget_constructors:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a constructor in a subclass of
      `Widget` that isn't private to its library doesn't have a parameter named
      `key`.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the constructor for
      the class `MyWidget` doesn't have a parameter named `key`:

      ```dart
      import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

      class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
        [!MyWidget!]({required int height});
      }
      ```

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the default
      constructor for the class `MyWidget` doesn't have a parameter named `key`:

      ```dart
      import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

      class [!MyWidget!] extends StatelessWidget {}
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Add a parameter named `key` to the constructor, explicitly declaring the
      constructor if necessary:

      ```dart
      import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

      class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
        MyWidget({super.key, required int height});
      }
      ```
  use_rethrow_when_possible:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a caught exception is thrown
      using a `throw` expression rather than a `rethrow` statement.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the caught exception
      `e` is thrown using a `throw` expression:

      ```dart
      void f() {
        try {
          // ...
        } catch (e) {
          [!throw e!];
        }
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Use `rethrow` instead of `throw`:

      ```dart
      void f() {
        try {
          // ...
        } catch (e) {
          rethrow;
        }
      }
      ```
  use_string_in_part_of_directives:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a `part of` directive uses a
      library name to refer to the library that the part is a part of.

      #### Example

      Given a file named `lib.dart` that contains the following:

      ```dart
      %uri="lib/lib.dart"
      library lib;

      part 'test.dart';
      ```

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the `part of`
      directive uses the name of the library rather than the URI of the library
      it's part of:

      ```dart
      [!part of lib;!]
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Use a URI to reference the library:

      ```dart
      part of 'lib.dart';
      ```
  use_super_parameters:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a parameter to a constructor is
      passed to a super constructor without being referenced or modified and a
      `super` parameter isn't used.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the parameters of the
      constructor for `B` are only used as arguments to the super constructor:

      ```dart
      class A {
        A({int? x, int? y});
      }
      class B extends A {
        [!B!]({int? x, int? y}) : super(x: x, y: y);
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Use a `super` parameter to pass the arguments:

      ```dart
      class A {
        A({int? x, int? y});
      }
      class B extends A {
        B({super.x, super.y});
      }
      ```
  valid_regexps:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the string passed to the
      default constructor of the class `RegExp` doesn't contain a valid regular
      expression.

      A regular expression created with invalid syntax will throw a
      `FormatException` at runtime.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the regular expression
      isn't valid:

      ```dart
      var r = RegExp([!r'('!]);
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      Fix the regular expression:

      ```dart
      var r = RegExp(r'\(');
      ```
  void_checks:
    documentation: |-
      #### Description

      The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a value is assigned to a
      variable of type `void`.

      It isn't possible to access the value of such a variable, so the
      assignment has no value.

      #### Example

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the field `value` has
      the type `void`, but a value is being assigned to it:

      ```dart
      class A<T> {
        T? value;
      }

      void f(A<void> a) {
        [!a.value = 1!];
      }
      ```

      The following code produces this diagnostic because the type of the
      parameter `p` in the method `m` is `void`, but a value is being assigned
      to it in the invocation:

      ```dart
      class A<T> {
        void m(T p) { }
      }

      void f(A<void> a) {
        a.m([!1!]);
      }
      ```

      #### Common fixes

      If the type of the variable is incorrect, then change the type of the
      variable:

      ```dart
      class A<T> {
        T? value;
      }

      void f(A<int> a) {
        a.value = 1;
      }
      ```

      If the type of the variable is correct, then remove the assignment:

      ```dart
      class A<T> {
        T? value;
      }

      void f(A<void> a) {}
      ```
