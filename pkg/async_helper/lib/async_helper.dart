/// This library is used for testing asynchronous tests.
/// If a test is asynchronous, it needs to notify the testing driver
/// about this (otherwise tests may get reported as passing [after main()
/// finished] even if the asynchronous operations fail).
///
/// This library provides four methods
///  - asyncStart(): Needs to be called before an asynchronous operation is
///                  scheduled.
///  - asyncEnd(): Needs to be called as soon as the asynchronous operation
///                ended.
///  - asyncSuccess(_): Variant of asyncEnd useful together with Future.then.
///  - asyncTest(f()): Helper method that wraps a computation that returns a
///                    Future with matching calls to asyncStart() and
///                    asyncSuccess(_).
/// After the last asyncStart() called was matched with a corresponding
/// asyncEnd() or asyncSuccess(_) call, the testing driver will be notified that
/// the tests is done.
