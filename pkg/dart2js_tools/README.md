### dart2js\_tools

This package collects tools used with dart2js.

For now, this contains scripts useful to work with obfuscated stack traces in
production and reading data from the extensions added to source-maps by dart2js
(like minified names and inlined stack frames).

In the future we plan to merge here tools in the dart2js\_info package as well.
