/// A command that verifies that deferred libraries split the code as expected.
///
/// This tool checks that the output from dart2js meets a given specification,
/// given in a YAML file. The format of the YAML file is:
///
///     main:
///       packages:
///         - some_package
///         - other_package
///
///     foo:
///       packages:
///         - foo
///         - bar
///
///     baz:
///       packages:
///         - baz
///         - quux
///
/// The YAML file consists of a list of declarations, one for each deferred
/// part expected in the output. At least one of these parts must be named
/// "main"; this is the main part that contains the program entrypoint. Each
/// top-level part contains a list of package names that are expected to be
/// contained in that part. Any package that is not explicitly listed is
/// expected to be in the main part. For instance, in the example YAML above
/// the part named "baz" is expected to contain the packages "baz" and "quux".
///
/// The names for parts given in the specification YAML file (besides "main")
/// are arbitrary and just used for reporting when the output does not meet the
/// specification.
