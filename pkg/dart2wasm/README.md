# Compiling Dart to WebAssembly

WebAssembly (commonly abbreviated to Wasm) is a
_"binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine"_.
Although Wasm was originally designed for running native code on the web,
Wasm has since evolved into a general technology for running
compiled code across multiple platforms.

The Dart team is currently investigating support for compiling Dart to Wasm,
in conjunction with support [in Flutter](https://flutter.dev/wasm).

**Note:** This feature is under active development,
and is currently considered experimental.
The tracking issue is [#32894](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/32894).

## Running dart2wasm

You don't need to build the Dart SDK to run dart2wasm, as long as you have a Dart SDK installed and have the [Dart SDK repository checked out](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/wiki/Building#getting-the-source). NB: the SDK must be checked out using depot tools and not just cloned from this repo.

To compile a Dart file to Wasm, in a checkout of the Dart SDK repository, run:

`dart --enable-asserts pkg/dart2wasm/bin/dart2wasm.dart` *options* *infile*`.dart` *outfile*`.wasm`

where *options* include:

| Option                                  | Default | Description |
| --------------------------------------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `--dart-sdk=`*path*                     | relative to script | The location of the `sdk` directory inside the Dart SDK, containing the core library sources.
| `--platform=`*path*                     | none    | The location of the platform `dill` file containing the compiled core libraries.
| `--depfile=`*path*                      | none    | Write a Ninja depfile listing the input sources for the compilation.
| `--`[`no-`]`export-all`                 | no      | Export all functions; otherwise, just export `main`.
| `--`[`no-`]`import-shared-memory`       | no      | Import a shared memory buffer. If this is on, `--shared-memory-max-pages` must also be specified.
| `--`[`no-`]`inlining`                   | yes     | Enable function inlining.
| `--inlining-limit` *size*               | 0       | Always inline functions no larger than this number of AST nodes, if inlining is enabled.
| `--`[`no-`]`name-section`               | yes     | Emit Name Section with function names.
| `--`[`no-`]`omit-type-checks`           | no      | Omit runtime type checks, such as covariance checks and downcasts.
| `--`[`no-`]`polymorphic-specialization` | no      | Do virtual calls by switching on the class ID instead of using `call_indirect`.
| `--`[`no-`]`print-kernel`               | no      | Print IR for each function before compiling it.
| `--`[`no-`]`print-wasm`                 | no      | Print Wasm instructions of each compiled function.
| `--`[`no-`]`enable-asserts`             | no      | Enable assertions at runtime.
| `--`[`no-`]`constant-branch-pruning`    | yes     | Avoid emitting code for dead branches of conditionals based on constants.
| `--shared-memory-max-pages` *pagecount* |         | Max size of the imported memory buffer. If `--shared-import-memory` is specified, this must also be specified.
| `--watch` *offset*                      |         | Print stack trace leading to the byte at offset *offset* in the `.wasm` output file. Can be specified multiple times.

Dart2Wasm will output a `wasm` file, containing Dart compiled to Wasm, as well as an `mjs` file containing the runtime. The result can be run with:

`d8 --experimental-wasm-gc --experimental-wasm-stack-switching --experimental-wasm-type-reflection pkg/dart2wasm/bin/run_wasm.js -- `*outfile*`.wasm` /abs/path/to/`*outfile*`.mjs

Where `d8` is the [V8 developer shell](https://v8.dev/docs/d8).

## Imports and exports

To import a function, declare it as a global, external function and mark it with a `wasm:import` pragma indicating the imported name (which must be two identifiers separated by a dot):
```dart
@pragma("wasm:import", "foo.bar")
external void fooBar(Object object);
```
which will call `foo.bar` on the host side:
```javascript
var foo = {
    bar: function(object) { /* implementation here */ }
};
```
To export a function, mark it with a `wasm:export` pragma:
```dart
@pragma("wasm:export")
void foo(double x) { /* implementation here */  }

@pragma("wasm:export", "baz")
void bar(double x) { /* implementation here */  }
```
With the Wasm module instance in `inst`, these can be called as:
```javascript
inst.exports.foo(1);
inst.exports.baz(2);
```

### Types to use for interop

In the signatures of imported and exported functions, use the following types:

- For numbers, use `double`.
- For JS objects, use the `WasmExternRef?` type from the `dart:wasm` package, which translates to the Wasm `externref` type. These can be passed around and stored as opaque values on the Dart side.
- For Dart objects, use the corresponding Dart type. This will be emitted as `externref` and automatically converted to and from the Dart type at the boundary.
