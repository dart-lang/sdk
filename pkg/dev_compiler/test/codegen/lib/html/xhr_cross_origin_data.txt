This is nonsense, especially when Linq and extension methods in C# have demonstrated a far superior approach, and Dart should provide an equivalent mechanism.\r\n\r\nAn obvious, easy way to add this would be that top level functions can optionally be called on an object using the dot operator, in which case the calling instance is passed as the first function parameter.\r\n\r\nE.g. to write a generic first method that operates over an iterator for a supplied predicate:\r\n\r\nT first&lt;T&gt;(Iterator&lt;T&gt; iterator, bool predicate(T obj)) {\r\n    while (iterator.hasNext()) {\r\n        if (predicate(iterator.next()) {\r\n            return true;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    return false;\r\n}\r\n\r\nThis could be called on an instance of an iterator as follows:\r\n\r\nvar jon = peopleIterator.first((p) =&gt; p.name == 'Jon');\r\n\r\nUsing extension methods that also return iterators, they can then chained together to form fluent expressions:\r\n\r\nvar fiveOldestJons = peopleInterator.where((p) =&gt; p.name == 'Jon').orderBy((p) =&gt; p.age).take(5);\r\n\r\nIt's worrying looking through the language design that you don't seem to looked much beyond JavaScript and Java for your inspiration in Dart. I can't speak for users of other languages, but I strongly doubt C# developers will be particularly impressed by a lot of the Java style anachronisms, and I'd urge you to cast your net a little more widely in general.","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/dart/issues/13/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/dart/issues/detail?id=13"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/dart/issues/full/13"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"jon.rimmer"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/jon.rimmer/"}}],"issues$closedDate":{"$t":"2011-10-12T13:44:38.000Z"},"issues$id":{"$t":13},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Type-Enhancement"},{"$t":"Priority-Medium"},{"$t":"Area-Language"}],"issues$stars":{"$t":25},"issues$state":{"$t":"closed"},"issues$status":{"$t":"WontFix"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"Ck4BRn47eCl7ImA9WhRaF04.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/dart/issues/full/14"},"published":{"$t":"2011-10-10T15:34:16.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2012-02-20T09:42:37.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"Add Tau constant to core Math class"},"content":{"$t":"With a new language, we are taking the opportunity to introduce better concepts, right?
