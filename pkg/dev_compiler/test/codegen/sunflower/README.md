This is a copy of https://github.com/dart-lang/sample-sunflower, with minor
changes to make it compile against "raw DOM" APIs.

The main sunflower.dart file is used as a regression test. You can find it at
../codegen/sunflower.dart with expected code under ../codegen/expect/sunflower/,
and the output is at ../codegen/expect/sunflower/sunflower.dart.js.
