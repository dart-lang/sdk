/**
 * An collection of key-value pairs, from which you retrieve a value
 * using its associated key.
 *
 * There is a finite number of keys in the map,
 * and each key has exactly one value associated with it.
 *
 * Maps, and their keys and values, can be iterated.
 * The order of iteration is defined by the individual type of map.
 * Examples:
 *
 * * The plain [HashMap] is unordered (no order is guaranteed),
 * * the [LinkedHashMap] iterates in key insertion order,
 * * and a sorted map like [SplayTreeMap] iterates the keys in sorted order.
 *
 * It is generally not allowed to modify the map (add or remove keys) while
 * an operation is being performed on the map, for example in functions called
 * during a [forEach] or [putIfAbsent] call.
 * Modifying the map while iterating the keys or values
 * may also break the iteration.

   *
   * For each element of the [iterable] this constructor computes a key-value
   * pair, by applying [key] and [value] respectively.
   *
   * The example below creates a new Map from a List. The keys of `map` are
   * `list` values converted to strings, and the values of the `map` are the
   * squares of the `list` values:
   *
   *     List<int> list = [1, 2, 3];

   *
   *     map['1'] + map['2']; // 1 + 4
   *     map['3'] - map['2']; // 9 - 4
   *
   * If no values are specified for [key] and [value] the default is the
   * identity function.
   *
   * In the following example, the keys and corresponding values of `map`
   * are `list` values:
   *
   *     map = new Map.fromIterable(list);
   *     map[1] + map[2]; // 1 + 2
   *     map[3] - map[2]; // 3 - 2
   *
   * The keys computed by the source [iterable] do not need to be unique. The
   * last occurrence of a key will simply overwrite any previous value.
