 * Because Object is the root of the Dart class hierarchy,

 *
 * When you define a class, you should override [toString]
 * to return a string describing an instance of that class.
 * You might also need to define [hashCode] and [==], as described in the
 * [Implementing map
 * keys](https://www.dartlang.org/docs/dart-up-and-running/ch03.html#implementing-map-keys)
 * section of the [library

   * Override this method to specify a different equality relation on
   * a class. The overriding method must still be an equivalence relation.
   * That is, it must be:
   *
   *  * Total: It must return a boolean for all arguments. It should never throw
   *    or return `null`.
   *
   *  * Reflexive: For all objects `o`, `o == o` must be true.
   *
   *  * Symmetric: For all objects `o1` and `o2`, `o1 == o2` and `o2 == o1` must
   *    either both be true, or both be false.
   *
   *  * Transitive: For all objects `o1`, `o2`, and `o3`, if `o1 == o2` and
   *    `o2 == o3` are true, then `o1 == o3` must be true.
   *
   * The method should also be consistent over time, so equality of two objects
   * should not change over time, or at least only change if one of the objects
   * was modified.
   *
   * If a subclass overrides the equality operator it should override
   * the [hashCode] method as well to maintain consistency.
