/**
 * A source of asynchronous data events.
 *
 * A Stream provides a way to receive a sequence of events.
 * Each event is either a data event or an error event,
 * representing the result of a single computation.
 * When the events provided by a Stream have all been sent,
 * a single "done" event will mark the end.
 *
 * You can [listen] on a stream to make it start generating events,
 * and to set up listeners that receive the events.
 * When you listen, you receive a [StreamSubscription] object
 * which is the active object providing the events,
 * and which can be used to stop listening again,
 * or to temporarily pause events from the subscription.
 *
 * There are two kinds of streams: "Single-subscription" streams and
 * "broadcast" streams.
 *
 * *A single-subscription stream* allows only a single listener during the whole
 * lifetime of the stream.
 * It doesn't start generating events until it has a listener,
 * and it stops sending events when the listener is unsubscribed,
 * even if the source of events could still provide more.
 *
 * Listening twice on a single-subscription stream is not allowed, even after
 * the first subscription has been canceled.
 *
 * Single-subscription streams are generally used for streaming chunks of
 * larger contiguous data like file I/O.
 *
 * *A broadcast stream* allows any number of listeners, and it fires
 * its events when they are ready, whether there are listeners or not.
 *
 * Broadcast streams are used for independent events/observers.
 *
 * If several listeners want to listen to a single subscription stream,
 * use [asBroadcastStream] to create a broadcast stream on top of the
 * non-broadcast stream.
 *
 * On either kind of stream, stream transformations, such as [where] and
 * [skip], return the same type of stream as the one the method was called on,
 * unless otherwise noted.
 *
 * When an event is fired, the listener(s) at that time will receive the event.
 * If a listener is added to a broadcast stream while an event is being fired,
 * that listener will not receive the event currently being fired.
 * If a listener is canceled, it immediately stops receiving events.
 *
 * When the "done" event is fired, subscribers are unsubscribed before
 * receiving the event. After the event has been sent, the stream has no
 * subscribers. Adding new subscribers to a broadcast stream after this point
 * is allowed, but they will just receive a new "done" event as soon
 * as possible.
 *
 * Stream subscriptions always respect "pause" requests. If necessary they need
 * to buffer their input, but often, and preferably, they can simply request
 * their input to pause too.
 *
 * The default implementation of [isBroadcast] returns false.
 * A broadcast stream inheriting from [Stream] must override [isBroadcast]
 * to return `true`.

   *

   *
   * The returned instance takes responsibility of implementing ([bind]).
   * When the user invokes `bind` it returns a new "bound" stream. Only when
   * the user starts listening to the bound stream, the `listen` method
   * invokes the given closure [transformer].
   *
   * The [transformer] closure receives the stream, that was bound, as argument
   * and returns a [StreamSubscription]. In almost all cases the closure
   * listens itself to the stream that is given as argument.
   *
   * The result of invoking the [transformer] closure is a [StreamSubscription].
   * The bound stream-transformer (created by the `bind` method above) then sets
   * the handlers it received as part of the `listen` call.
   *
   * Conceptually this can be summarized as follows:
   *
   * 1. `var transformer = new StreamTransformer(transformerClosure);`
   *   creates a `StreamTransformer` that supports the `bind` method.
   * 2. `var boundStream = stream.transform(transformer);` binds the `stream`
   *   and returns a bound stream that has a pointer to `stream`.
   * 3. `boundStream.listen(f1, onError: f2, onDone: f3, cancelOnError: b)`
   *   starts the listening and transformation. This is accomplished
   *   in 2 steps: first the `boundStream` invokes the `transformerClosure` with
   *   the `stream` it captured: `transformerClosure(stream, b)`.
   *   The result `subscription`, a [StreamSubscription], is then
   *   updated to receive its handlers: `subscription.onData(f1)`,
   *   `subscription.onError(f2)`, `subscription(f3)`. Finally the subscription
   *   is returned as result of the `listen` call.
   *
   * There are two common ways to create a StreamSubscription:
   *
   * 1. by creating a new class that implements [StreamSubscription].
   *    Note that the subscription should run callbacks in the [Zone] the
   *    stream was listened to.
   * 2. by allocating a [StreamController] and to return the result of
   *    listening to its stream.
