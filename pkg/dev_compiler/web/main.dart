/// Command line entry point for Dart Development Compiler (dartdevc).
///
/// Supported commands are
///   * compile: builds a collection of dart libraries into a single JS module
///
/// Additionally, these commands are being considered
///   * link:  combines several JS modules into a single JS file
///   * build: compiles & links a set of code, automatically determining
///            appropriate groupings of libraries to combine into JS modules
///   * watch: watch a directory and recompile build units automatically
///   * serve: uses `watch` to recompile and exposes a simple static file server
///            for local development
///
/// These commands are combined so we have less names to expose on the PATH,
/// and for development simplicity while the precise UI has not been determined.
///
/// A more typical structure for web tools is simply to have the compiler with
/// "watch" as an option. The challenge for us is:
///
/// * Dart used to assume whole-program compiles, so we don't have a
///   user-declared unit of building, and neither "libraries" or "packages" will
///   work,
/// * We do not assume a `node` JS installation, so we cannot easily reuse
///   existing tools for the "link" step, or assume users have a local
///   file server,
/// * We didn't have a file watcher API at first,
/// * We had no conventions about where compiled output should go (or even
///   that we would be compiling at all, vs running on an in-browser Dart VM),
/// * We wanted a good first impression with our simple examples, so we used
///   local file servers, and users have an expectation of it now, even though
///   it doesn't scale to typical apps that need their own real servers.
