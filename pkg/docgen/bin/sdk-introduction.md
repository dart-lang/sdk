Welcome to the Dart API reference documentation,
covering the official Dart API libraries.
Some of the most fundamental Dart libraries include:

* [dart:core](#dart:core):
  Core functionality such as strings, numbers, collections, errors,
  dates, and URIs.
* [dart:html](#dart:html):
  DOM manipulation for web apps.
* [dart:io](#dart:io):
  I/O for command-line apps.

Except for dart:core, you must import a library before you can use it.
Here's an example of importing dart:html, dart:math, and a
third popular library called
[polymer.dart](http://www.dartlang.org/polymer-dart/):

    import 'dart:html';
    import 'dart:math';
    import 'package:polymer/polymer.dart';

Polymer.dart is an example of a library that isn't
included in the Dart download,
but is easy to get and update using the _pub package manager_.
For information on finding, using, and publishing libraries (and more)
with pub, see
