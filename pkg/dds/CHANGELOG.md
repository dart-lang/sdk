- Added a retry to the DevTools handler for serving static files.
- Updated `devtools_shared` to ^4.0.0.

# 2.10.0
- Updated `devtools_shared` to ^3.0.0.

# 2.9.5
- [DAP] The change to use VM Service Isolate numbers for `threadId`s has been reverted because Isolate numbers can be larger than the 32-bit integers allowed in DAP.
- [DAP] Threads returned from `threadsRequest` from the DDS DAP handler now include `isolateId` fields to allow mapping back to VM Service Isolates.

- [DAP] Fix ConcurrentModificationError when sending breakpoints.

# 2.9.2
- [DAP] Fixed an issue that could cause breakpoints to become unresolved when there are multiple isolates (such as during a test run).
- [DAP] Fixed an issue where stack frames parsed in test failures could produce incorrect absolute paths in the `source.path` field if the working directory of the debug adapter did not match that of the launch/attach request.
- [DAP] A new configuration option `bool? allowAnsiColorOutput` can enable using ansi color codes in `Output` events to improve readability of stack traces (fading out frames that are not user code).
- Increase minimum Dart SDK version to 3.0.0.

# 2.9.1
- [DAP] A new configuration option `bool? showGettersInDebugViews` allows getters to be shown wrapped in Variables/Evaluation responses so that they can be lazily expanded by the user. `evaluateGettersInDebugViews` must be `false` for this behaviour.
- [DAP] `runInTerminal` requests are now sent after first responding to the `launchRequest`.
- [DAP] Skipped tests are now marked with `!` instead of `âœ“` in `Output` events.

# 2.7.9
- [DAP] Configuring and resuming isolates will no longer cause a crash if the isolate exits before the request is processed.

# 2.7.8
- [DAP] Sentinel values (such as uninitialized fields/locals) will no longer cause `scopesRequest`/`variablesRequest` to fail, instead showing appropriate text (like "<not initialized>") against the variable.

# 2.7.7
- [DAP] Debug adapters now only call `setLibraryDebuggable` when the debuggable flag changes from the default/current values, reducing the amount of VM Service traffic for new isolates/reloads.
- [DAP] `breakpoint` events are no longer sometimes sent prior to the response to the `setBreakpointsRequest` that created them.

# 2.7.6
- [DAP] `scopesRequest` now returns a `Globals` scope containing global variables for the current frame.

- Simplified the DevTools URI composed by DDS.
- Fix issue where DDS was invoking an unimplemented RPC against a non-VM target.

- [DAP] Added support for sending progress notifications via `DartDebugAdapter.startProgressNotification`.
  Standard progress events are sent when a clients sets `supportsProgressReporting: true` in its capabilities,
  unless `sendCustomProgressEvents: true` is included in launch configuration, in which case prefixed (`dart.`) custom notifications will be sent instead.

# 2.3.1
- Fixed issue where DDS wasn't correctly handling `Sentinel` responses in `IsolateManager.initialize()`.

# 2.3.0
