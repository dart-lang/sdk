# Overview

This document describes the Dart Tooling Daemon protocol. This daemon, and it's
protocol is meant to facilitate communication channels between various tools.

To start a tooling daemon run `dart tooling-daemon`.

The Dart Tooling Daemon Protocol uses JSON-RPC 2.0.

## Streams

The following is a visualization of normal stream interaction. It is presented in function notation, instead of RPC calls, for brevity.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant c1 as Client 1
    participant c2 as Client 2
    participant dtd as Dart Tooling Daemon
    participant c3 as Client 3

    c1->>dtd: streamListen(streamId: "foo")
    activate dtd
    dtd-->>c1: Success
    deactivate dtd

    c2->>dtd: streamListen(streamId: "foo")
    activate dtd
    dtd-->>c2: Success
    deactivate dtd

    Note right of c2: Client 1 and Client 2 are now listening to the "foo" stream.
    Note right of dtd: Client 3 posts an event to the "foo" stream.

    c3->>dtd: postEvent( streamId: "foo", eventKind: "example", eventData: { "bar": "baz" })
    activate dtd
    dtd-->>c3: Success

    Note right of c2: Client 1 and Client 2 are forwarded the event using streamNotify.
    dtd-->>c2: streamNotify( streamId: "foo", eventKind: "example", eventData: { "bar": "baz" })
    dtd-->>c1: streamNotify( streamId: "foo", eventKind: "example", eventData: { "bar": "baz" })
    deactivate dtd

    Note right of c2: Client 2 now cancels listening to the "foo" stream.
    c2-->>dtd: streamCancel(streamId: "foo")
    activate dtd
    dtd-->>c2: Success
    deactivate dtd

    Note right of dtd: Client 3 posts another event to the "foo" stream.
    c3->>dtd: postEvent( streamId: "foo", eventKind: "example", eventData: { "bar": "baz 2" })
    activate dtd
    dtd-->>c3: Success

    Note right of c2: Client 1 is still listening to the "foo" stream, so the event<br/>is still forwarded to it using streamNotify.
    dtd-->>c1: streamNotify( streamId: "foo", eventKind: "example", eventData: { "bar": "baz2 " })
    deactivate dtd
```

## Service Methods

The following is a visualization of normal service method interaction. It is presented in function notation, instead of RPC calls, for brevity.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant c1 as Client 1
    participant dtd as Dart Tooling Daemon
    participant c2 as Client 2

    Note right of c1: Client 1 registers the foo.bar method.
    c1->>dtd: registerService(service: "foo", method: "bar)
    activate dtd
    dtd-->>c1: Success
    deactivate dtd

    Note left of c2: Client 2 calls foo.bar
    c2->>dtd: foo.bar({{"a": 1, "b": 2}})
    activate dtd

    Note left of dtd: dtd forwards the service method call to Client 1.
    dtd->>c1: foo.bar({{"a": 1, "b": 2}})
    activate c1

    Note right of c1: Client 1 handles the<br/>request and responds to the Dart Tooling Daemon.
    c1-->>dtd: {"example": "response"}
    deactivate c1

    Note right of dtd: Dart Tooling Daemon forwards the response to Client 2.
    dtd-->>c2: {"example": "response"}
    deactivate dtd
```

# Interacting with the Dart Tooling Daemon

## package:dtd

[package:dtd](https://pub.dev/packages/dtd) is available for use with Dart.
It facilitates access to the Dart Tooling Daemon, by providing a convenient Dart
interface.

## Dart Tooling Daemon protocol

Alternatively you can interact with the tooling daemon using the RPC protocol
directly.

### `streamListen`

Registers the calling client as listening to the stream named _streamId_.

The calling client will then receive [streamNotify](#streamnotify) calls when
any client calls [postEvent](#postevent) on the _streamId_ stream.

#### Parameters

`String streamId` - The name of the stream to start listening to.

#### Result

If successful responds with [Success](#success).

If the client is already subscribed to the stream, the _103_ (Stream already
subscribed) [RPC error](#rpc-error) code is returned.

#### Code Sample

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "streamListen",
  "params": {
    "streamId": "foo_stream"
  },
  "id": "2"
}
```

#### Response

```json
{"id": "2", "type": "Success"}
```

### `streamCancel`

Unregisters the calling client from listening to the stream named _streamId_.

The calling client will no longer receive [streamNotify](#streamnotify) method
calls for events on the _streamId_ stream.

#### Parameters

`String streamId` - The name of the stream to stop listening to.

#### Result

If successful responds with [Success](#success).

If the client is not subscribed to the stream, the _104_ (Stream not
subscribed) [RPC error](#rpc-error) code is returned.

#### Code Sample

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "streamCancel",
  "params": {
    "streamId": "foo_stream"
  },
  "id": "2"
}
```

#### Response

```json
{"id": "2", "type": "Success"}
```

### `postEvent`

Calls [streamNotify](#streamnotify) on all clients that are currently
[streamListen](#streamlisten)ing to the _streamId_ stream.

#### Parameters

- `String streamId` - The stream to post the event to
- `String eventKind` - The kind of event being sent.
- `Map<String, Object?> eventData` - A map object of data to send with the
  event. _eventData_ must be serializable to json.

#### Result

If successful responds with [Success](#success).

#### Code Sample

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "postEvent",
  "params": {
    "streamId": "fooStream",
    "eventKind": "bar",
    "eventData": { "bazKey": "apple" }
  },
  "id": "2"
}
```

#### Response

```json
{"id": "2", "type": "Success"}
```

### `registerService`

Registers the calling client as the handler for any service method calls where
the service is _service_ and the method is _method_.

To call the method registered by this call, a client can send a
[service method](#servicemethod) call to the Dart Tooling Daemon.

When a client disconnects, then all of the service methods registered to it are
removed.

#### Parameters

- `String service` - The name of the service to register the client to. Once a
  client has registered a method to a service then only that client can register
  other methods to that service.
- `String method` - The name of the method to register to _service_.

#### Result

If successful responds with [Success](#success).

If the _service_ has already been registered by another client , the _111_ (Service already registered) [RPC error](#rpc-error) code is returned.

If the _method_ has already been registered on the _service_, the _132_ (Service method already registered) [RPC error](#rpc-error) code is returned.

#### Code Sample

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "registerService",
  "params": {
    "service": "foo",
    "method": "bar",
  },
  "id": "2"
}
```

#### Response

```json
{"id": "2", "type": "Success"}
```

### `service`.`method`

Triggers the service method registered by [registerService](#registerservice),
for _service_ and _method_.

Dart Tooling Daemon will forward the service method call to the client that
[registered](#registerservice) it. The client's response will be returned from this
method call.

#### Parameters

The parameters must be a `Map<String, Object?>` where the contents are defined
on a case by case basis on the expectations of the client who registered
the service method.

#### Result

The result is defined on a case by case basis based on the implementer of the
service method.

If service method does not exist, the -32601 (Method not found)
[RPC error](#rpc-error) code is returned.

#### Code Sample

Assume that a client has registered a service method with:

- service: `foo`
- method: `bar`

Then calling that service method might look like:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "foo.bar",
  "params": { "baz": 3 },
  "id": "2"
}
```

#### Response

The response is defined on a case by case basis based on the implementer of the
service method.

## DTD Client Responsibilities

When creating a client that interacts with the Dart Tooling Daemon, implement
the following methods in order to participate in the full lifecycle.

### streamNotify

In order to handle messages posted to streams that the client is
[streamListen](#streamlisten)ing to, then the calling client may handle incoming
`streamNotify` RPC methods.

When any client calls [postEvent](#postevent) for a given _streamId , if a
client has[streamListen](#streamlisten)ed to _streamId_, then that client
will receive `streamNotify` method calls for those events. Implement this method
in order to receive those calls.

#### Parameters

- `String streamId` - The stream to post the event to
- `String eventKind` - The kind of event being sent.
- `Map<String, Object?> eventData` - A map object of data to send with the
  event.

#### Result

No response is given since this is sent as a notification.

#### Code Sample

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "streamNotify",
    "params": {
        "streamId": "fooStream",
        "eventKind": "bar",
        "eventData": { "baz": "car" }
    },
    "id": "2"
}
```

#### Response

None, `streamNotify` is called as a notification and expects no response.

### `service`.`method`

Any time the client calls [registerService](#registerservice) then it will
receive method calls for that service method.

The method name will take the form `service`.`method`. Any response returned by
the RPC handler will be forwarded to the service method caller.

#### Parameters

The parameters are defined on a case by case basis based on the expectations of
the client who registered the service method.

#### Result

The result is defined on a case by case basis based on the implementer of the
service method.

#### Code Sample

Assume that a client has registered a service method with:

- service: `foo`
- method: `bar`

Then calling that service method might look like:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "foo.bar",
  "params": { "baz": 3 },
  "id": "2"
}
```

#### Response

The response is defined on a case by case basis based on the implementer of the
service method. It should be a valid RPC response.

# Responses

## Success

Methods that respond with Success do so with the following RPC.

```json
{"id": "2", "type": "Success"}
```

## RPC Error

When an RPC encounters an error, it is provided in the _error_
property of the response object. JSON-RPC errors always provide
_code_, _message_, and _data_ properties.

Here is an example error response for our [streamListen](#streamlisten)
request above. This error would be generated if we were attempting to
subscribe to the _GC_ stream multiple times from the same client.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "error": {
    "code": 103,
    "message": "Stream already subscribed",
    "data": {
      "details": "The stream 'GC' is already subscribed"
    }
  }
  "id": "2"
}
```

In addition to the
[error codes](http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#error_object) specified in
the JSON-RPC spec, we use the following application specific error codes:
code | message | meaning
---- | ------- | -------
-32601 | Method not found | The method does not exist / is not available.
-32602 | Invalid params | Invalid params. Invalid method parameter(s).
103 | Stream already subscribed | The client is already subscribed to the specified _streamId_.
104 | Stream not subscribed | The client is not subscribed to the specified _streamId_.
111 | Service already registered | Service with such name has already been registered by this client.
112 | Service disappeared | Failed to fulfill service request, likely service handler is no longer available.
132 | Service method already registered | Method for the given service has already been registered by this client.
