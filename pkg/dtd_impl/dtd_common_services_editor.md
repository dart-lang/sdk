# Editor Services

This document describes a common interface for service methods that editors/IDEs
may provide over DTD.

For a full list of common services, see [common_services](./dtd_common_services.md).

# Methods

Callers of these methods should monitor the
[`Service` stream](./dtd_protocol.md#service-methods) to ensure they are
available before calling them (it is not guaranteed that all editors provide
all methods).


## navigateToCode
`Success navigateToCode(NavigateToCodeParams)`

Instructs the editor to open and navigate to a file (and optional line/column).


## getDevices
`GetDevicesResult getDevices()`

Requests the list of available devices from the editor. Devices can include
connected mobile devices, web browsers and the desktop device. The `supported`
flag can be used to tell whether a particular device is enabled in the current
workspace.

Callers of this method should first subscribe to the [`deviceXXX`](#deviceAdded)
events to be notified when devices are added/removed/updated.


## getDebugSessions
`GetDebugSessionsResult getDebugSessions()`

Requests a list of active debug sessions from the editor.

Callers of this method should first subscribe to the
[`debugSessionXXX`](#debugSessionStarted) events to be notified when debug
sessions are started/stopped/updated.


## selectDevice
`Success selectDevice(SelectDeviceParams)`

Instructs the editor to select a specific device (or no device). Callers should
not assume the active device has changed until they receive a `deviceSelected`
event.


## enablePlatformType
`Success enablePlatformType(EnablePlatformTypeParams)`

Instructs the editor to enable a `platformType` for the current workspace. This
may trigger a prompt to the user followed by executing commands (such as
`flutter create`). Callers should not assume the platform is enabled until they
receive a `deviceUpdated` event that shows `supported=true` for the devices of
that type.


## hotReload
`Success hotReload(HotReloadParams)`

Instructs the editor to trigger a hot reload for the provided debug session.


## hotRestart
`Success hotRestart(HotRestartParams)`

Instructs the editor to trigger a hot restart for the provided debug session.


## openDevToolsPage
`Success openDevToolsPage(OpenDevToolsPageParams)`

Instructs the editor to open DevTools at the given page for the provided debug
session.


# Events

The following events are sent over the `Editor` stream. See `streamListen` in
[dtd_protocol](./dtd_protocol.md) for information on subscribing to streams.


## deviceAdded
`DeviceAddedEvent`

An event sent by an editor when a new device becomes available.


## deviceRemoved
`DeviceRemovedEvent`

An event sent by an editor when a device is no longer available.


## deviceChanged
`DeviceChangedEvent`

An event sent by an editor when an existing device is updated.

The ID in this event always matches an existing device (that is, the ID never
changes, or it would be considered a removal/add).


## deviceSelected
`DeviceSelectedEvent`

An event sent by an editor when the current selected device was changed.

This could be as a result of the client itself calling the `selectDevice`
method or because the device changed for another reason (such as the user
selecting a device in the editor directly, or the previously selected device
is being removed).


## debugSessionStarted
`DebugSessionStartedEvent`

An event sent by an editor when a new debug session is started.


## debugSessionStopped
`DebugSessionStoppedEvent`

An event sent by an editor when a debug session ends.


## debugSessionChanged
`DebugSessionChangedEvent`

An event sent by an editor when a debug session is changed.

This could happen when a VM Service URI becomes available for a session
launched in debug mode, for example.


## themeChanged
`ThemeChangedEvent`

An event sent by an editor when its theme has changed.

This could happen when a user changes their settings to toggle between light
and dark mode or increase/decrease font size.
