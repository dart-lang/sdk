/// Interface for sentinel values used for typed `null` values on a stack.
///
/// This is used to avoid mixing `null` values between different kinds. For
/// instance a stack entry is meant to contain an expression or null, the
/// `NullValues.Expression` is pushed on the stack instead of `null` and when
/// popping the entry `NullValues.Expression` is passed show how `null` is
/// represented.
