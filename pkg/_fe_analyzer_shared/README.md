# FE/analyzer shared code

This package contains logic that is shared between the front_end and
analyzer packages.  It is intended solely to facilitate development of
the Dart SDK, and is not intended for use by end users.  In
particular, this package has no public API, so no guarantee is made of
compatibility between one version of the package and the next.

End users should consider using the analyzer package to analyze Dart
source code.
