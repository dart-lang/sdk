  This package is not intended for wide use. It provides a temporary API to
  solve the problem: "Given an object some generic type A, how do I construct an
  instance of generic type B with the same type argument(s)?"

  This is necessary in a few rare places in order to migrate existing code to
  Dart 2's stronger type system. Eventually, the hope is to have direct
  language support for solving this problem but we don't have time to get that
  into 2.0, so this package is provided as a temporary workaround.

  We will very likely remove support for this in a later version of Dart.

environment:
  # Restrict the upper bound so that we can remove support for this in a later
  # version of the SDK without it being a breaking change.
  sdk: ">=2.10.0-0 <2.12.0"
