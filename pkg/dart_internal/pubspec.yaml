  This package is not intended for any external use. Basically, if you don't
  personally know exactly what it's for, you're probably not the intended user.

  It contains functionality to enable some internal Google code to transition
  to strong mode before some anticipated language features are in place. In
  particular, it provides an API to solve the problem: "Given an object some
  generic type A, how do I construct an instance of generic type B with the
  same type argument(s)?"
