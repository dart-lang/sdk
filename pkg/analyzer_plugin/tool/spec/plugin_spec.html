<h1>Analysis Server Plugin API Specification</h1>
<h1 style="color:#999999">Version
  <version>1.0.0-alpha.0</version>
</h1>
<p>
  This document contains a specification of the API used by the analysis
  server to communicate with analysis server plugins. Changes to the API will be
  accompanied by an update to the protocol version number according to the
  principles of semantic versioning
  (<a href="http://semver.org/">semver.org</a>).
</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>

    <result>
      <field name="isCompatible">
        <ref>bool</ref>
        <p>
          A flag indicating whether the plugin supports the same version of the

      <field name="name">
        <ref>String</ref>
        <p>

    </p>
  </request>
  <notification event="error">
    <p>
      Used to report that an unexpected error has occurred while executing the
      plugin. This notification is not used for problems with specific requests

      exceptions that occur while performing other tasks, such as analysis or
      preparing notifications.
    </p>

        </p>
      </field>
    </params>
  </request>
  <request method="reanalyze">
    <p>
      Used to force the re-analysis of everything contained in the specified
      context roots. This should cause all previously computed analysis results
      to be discarded and recomputed, and should cause all subscribed
      notifications to be re-sent.
    </p>
    <params>
      <field name="roots" optional="true">
        <list>
          <ref>FilePath</ref>
        </list>
        <p>
          A list of the context roots that are to be re-analyzed.
        </p>
        <p>
          If no context roots are provided, then all current context roots
          should be re-analyzed.
        </p>
      </field>
    </params>
  </request>
  <request method="setContextBuilderOptions">
    <p>
      Used to set the options used to build analysis contexts. This request will
      be sent exactly once before any context roots have been specified.

    <params>
      <field name="options">
        <ref>ContextBuilderOptions</ref>
        <p>
          The options used to build the analysis contexts.

          <ref>ContextRoot</ref>
        </list>
        <p>
          A list of the context roots that should be analyzed.
        </p>
      </field>
    </params>
  </request>
  <request method="setPriorityFiles">
    <p>
      Used to set the priority files to the files in the given list. A priority
      file is a file that should be given priority when scheduling which
      analysis work to do first. The list typically contains those files that
      are visible to the user and those for which analysis results will have the
      biggest impact on the user experience. The order of the files within the
      list is significant: the first file will be given higher priority than
      the second, the second higher priority than the third, and so on.
    </p>
    <params>
      <field name="files">
        <list>
          <ref>FilePath</ref>
        </list>

        </p>
      </field>
    </params>
  </request>
  <request method="setSubscriptions">
    <p>
      Used to subscribe for services that are specific to individual files. All
      previous subscriptions should be replaced by the current set of
      subscriptions. If a given service is not included as a key in the map then
      no files should be subscribed to the service, exactly as if the service
      had been included in the map with an explicit empty list of files.
    </p>
    <params>
      <field name="subscriptions">
        <map>
          <key>
            <ref>AnalysisService</ref>

          <value>
            <list>
              <ref>FilePath</ref>
            </list>
          </value>
        </map>
        <p>
          A table mapping services to a list of the files being subscribed to
          the service.
        </p>
      </field>
    </params>
  </request>
  <request method="updateContent">
    <p>
      Used to update the content of one or more files. Files that were
      previously updated but not included in this update remain unchanged. This
      effectively represents an overlay of the filesystem. The files whose
      content is overridden are therefore seen by the plugin as being files with
      the given content, even if the files do not exist on the filesystem or if
      the file path represents the path to a directory on the filesystem.
    </p>
    <params>
      <field name="files">
        <map>
          <key>
            <ref>FilePath</ref>
          </key>
          <value>
            <union field="type">
              <ref>AddContentOverlay</ref>
              <ref>ChangeContentOverlay</ref>
              <ref>RemoveContentOverlay</ref>
            </union>
          </value>
        </map>
        <p>
          A table mapping the files whose content has changed to a description
          of the content change.
        </p>
      </field>
    </params>
  </request>
  <notification event="errors">
    <p>
      Used to report the errors associated with a given file. The set of errors
      included in the notification is always a complete list that supersedes any
      previously reported errors.
    </p>
    <params>
      <field name="file">
        <ref>FilePath</ref>
        <p>
          The file containing the errors.
        </p>
      </field>
      <field name="errors">
        <list>
          <ref>AnalysisError</ref>
        </list>
        <p>
          The errors contained in the file.
        </p>
      </field>
    </params>
  </notification>
  <notification event="folding">
    <p>
      Used to report the folding regions associated with a given file. Folding
      regions can be nested, but cannot be overlapping. Nesting occurs when a
      foldable element, such as a method, is nested inside another foldable
      element such as a class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Folding regions that overlap a folding region computed by the server, or
      by one of the other plugins that are currently running, might be dropped
      by the server in order to present a consistent view to the client.
    </p>
    <p>
      This notification should only be sent if the server has subscribed to it
      by including the value <tt>"FOLDING"</tt> in the list of services
      passed in an analysis.setSubscriptions request.
    </p>
    <params>
      <field name="file">
        <ref>FilePath</ref>
        <p>
          The file containing the folding regions.

          <ref>FoldingRegion</ref>
        </list>
        <p>
          The folding regions contained in the file.
        </p>
      </field>
    </params>
  </notification>
  <notification event="highlights">
    <p>
      Used to report the highlight regions associated with a given file. Each
      highlight region represents a particular syntactic or semantic meaning
      associated with some range. Note that the highlight regions that are
      returned can overlap other highlight regions if there is more than one
      meaning associated with a particular region.
    </p>
    <p>
      This notification should only be sent if the server has subscribed to it
      by including the value <tt>"HIGHLIGHTS"</tt> in the list of services
      passed in an analysis.setSubscriptions request.
    </p>
    <params>
      <field name="file">
        <ref>FilePath</ref>
        <p>
          The file containing the highlight regions.
        </p>
      </field>
      <field name="regions">
        <list>
          <ref>HighlightRegion</ref>
        </list>
        <p>
          The highlight regions contained in the file.
        </p>
      </field>
    </params>
  </notification>
  <notification event="navigation">
    <p>
      Used to report the navigation regions associated with a given file. Each
      navigation region represents a list of targets associated with some range.
      The lists will usually contain a single target, but can contain more in
      the case of a part that is included in multiple libraries or in Dart code
      that is compiled against multiple versions of a package. Note that the
      navigation regions that are returned should not overlap other navigation
      regions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Navigation regions that overlap a navigation region computed by the
      server, or by one of the other plugins that are currently running, might
      be dropped or modified by the server in order to present a consistent view
      to the client.
    </p>
    <p>
      This notification should only be sent if the server has subscribed to it
      by including the value <tt>"NAVIGATION"</tt> in the list of services
      passed in an analysis.setSubscriptions request.

      <field name="targets">
        <list>
          <ref>NavigationTarget</ref>
        </list>
        <p>
          The navigation targets referenced in the file. They are referenced by
          <a href="#type_NavigationRegion">NavigationRegion</a>s by their index
          in this array.
        </p>
      </field>
      <field name="files">
        <list>
          <ref>FilePath</ref>
        </list>
        <p>
          The files containing navigation targets referenced in the file. They
          are referenced by
          <a href="#type_NavigationTarget">NavigationTarget</a>s by their index

    </params>
  </notification>
  <notification event="occurrences">
    <p>
      Used to report the occurrences of references to elements within a single
      file. None of the occurrence regions should overlap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Occurrence regions that overlap an occurrence region computed by the
      server, or by one of the other plugins that are currently running, might
      be dropped or modified by the server in order to present a consistent view
      to the client.
    </p>
    <p>
      This notification should only be sent if the server has subscribed to it
      by including the value <tt>"OCCURRENCES"</tt> in the list of services
      passed in an analysis.setSubscriptions request.
    </p>
    <params>
      <field name="file">

  <notification event="outline">
    <p>
      Used to report the outline fragments associated with a single file.
    </p>
    <p>
      The outline fragments will be merged with any outline produced by the
      server and with any fragments produced by other plugins. If the server
      cannot create a coherent outline, some fragments might be dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      This notification should only be sent if the server has subscribed to it
      by including the value <tt>"OUTLINE"</tt> in the list of services

        <p>
          The offset of the start of the text to be replaced. This will be
          different than the offset used to request the completion suggestions
          if there was a portion of an identifier before the original offset. In

    This section contains additional information for each kind of refactoring.
    In addition to a brief description of the refactoring, there is a
    specification of the feedback that is provided when a refactoring is
    requested using the
    <a href="request_edit.getRefactoring">edit.getRefactoring</a> request
    (designed to improve the UX) and the options that may be provided to
