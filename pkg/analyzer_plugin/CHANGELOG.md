## 0.3.1-dev
- Deprecated the class `DartChangeBuilder` and enhanced `ChangeBuilder` to be
  the replacement for it.
- Deprecated the method `ChangeBuilder.addFileEdit` and introduced
  `ChangeBuilder.addDartFileEdit` and `ChangeBuilder.addGenericFileEdit` to be
  the replacements for it.
- Bump maximum supported version of the analyzer to `<0.41.0`.

## 0.3.0
- Removed deprecated `Plugin.getResolveResult`. Use `getResolvedUnitResult`.

## 0.2.5
- Change supported analyzer version to `^0.39.12`

## 0.2.4
- Exposed method `AnalyzerConverter.locationFromElement` (was previously
  private).

## 0.2.3
- Added class `Relevance`.
- Removed `FixKind.name`, replaced with `FixKind.id`.  Technically this is a
  breaking change but we believe that in practice it is benign, since
  `FixKind.name` was only used for debugging.
- Added function `computeDartNavigation`.
- Note: never published (had problematic imports of package:analysis_server).
