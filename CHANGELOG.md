## 1.11.2

### Core library changes

* Fix a bug where `WebSocket.close()` would crash if called after
  `WebSocket.cancel()`.

## 1.11.1

### Tool changes

* Pub will always load Dart SDK assets from the SDK whose `pub` executable was
  run, even if a `DART_SDK` environment variable is set.

## 1.11.0

### Core library changes

* In `dart:html`, `appendHtml` and `insertAdjacentHtml` now take `nodeValidator`
  and `treeSanitizer` parameters, and the inputs are consistently
  sanitized. See [45818 announcement]
  [45818 announcement](https://groups.google.com/a/dartlang.org/forum/#!topic/announce/GVO7EAcPi6A)
* List iterators may not throw ConcurrentModificationError as eagerly in
  release mode. In checked mode, the modification check is still as eager
  as possible.
  [r45198](https://code.google.com/p/dart/source/detail?r=45198)
* `dart:core`
  * Add `unmodifiable` constructor to `List` -
    [r45334](https://code.google.com/p/dart/source/detail?r=45334)
  * Add `unmodifiable` constructor to `Map` -
    [r45733](https://code.google.com/p/dart/source/detail?r=45733)
  * Add `empty` constructor to `Iterable` -
    [dcf0286f](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/commit/dcf0286f5385187a68ce9e66318d3bf19abf454b)
* `dart:isolate`:
  * Make the priority parameter of `Isolate.ping` and `Isolate.kill` methods
    a named parameter named `priority`.
  * Remove the `Isolate.AS_EVENT` priority.
  * Add extra `response` parameter to `Isolate.ping` and
    `Isolate.addOnExitListener` -
    [r45092](https://code.google.com/p/dart/source/detail?r=45092)
  * Remove the experimental state of the API.

### Tool changes

* This is the last release that ships the (unsupported)
  dart2dart (aka `dart2js --output-type=dart`) utility as part
  of dart2js

## 1.10.0 – 2015-04-29

### Core library changes

* `dart:convert`
  * **POTENTIALLY BREAKING** Fix behavior of `HtmlEscape`. It no longer escapes
  no-break space (U+00A0) anywhere or forward slash (`/`, `U+002F`) in element
  context. Slash is still escaped using `HtmlEscapeMode.UNKNOWN`.
  [r45003](https://code.google.com/p/dart/source/detail?r=45003),
  [r45153](https://code.google.com/p/dart/source/detail?r=45153),
  [r45189](https://code.google.com/p/dart/source/detail?r=45189)

* `dart:core`
  * `Uri.parse` added `start` and `end` positional arguments.

* `dart:html`
  * **POTENTIALLY BREAKING** `CssClassSet` method arguments must now be 'tokens', i.e. non-empty
  strings with no white-space characters. The implementation was incorrect for
  class names containing spaces. The fix is to forbid spaces and provide a
  faster implementation.
  [Announcement](https://groups.google.com/a/dartlang.org/d/msg/announce/jmUI2XJHfC8/UZUCvJH3p2oJ)

* `dart:io`

  * `ProcessResult` now exposes a constructor.
  * `import` and `Isolate.spawnUri` now supports the
    [Data URI scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme) on the VM.

## Tool Changes

### pub

  * Running `pub run foo` within a package now runs the `foo` executable defined
    by the `foo` package. The previous behavior ran `bin/foo`. This makes it
    easy to run binaries in dependencies, for instance `pub run test`.

  * On Mac and Linux, signals sent to `pub run` and forwarded to the child
    command.

## 1.9.3 – 2015-04-14

## 1.9.1 – 2015-03-25

### Language changes

* Support for `async`, `await`, `sync*`, `async*`, `yield`, `yield*`, and `await
  for`. See the [the language tour][async] for more details.

* Enum support is fully enabled. See [the language tour][enum] for more details.

[async]: https://www.dartlang.org/docs/dart-up-and-running/ch02.html#asynchrony
[enum]: https://www.dartlang.org/docs/dart-up-and-running/ch02.html#enums

### Tool changes

* The formatter is much more comprehensive and generates much more readable
  code. See [its tool page][dartfmt] for more details.

* The analysis server is integrated into the IntelliJ plugin and the Dart
  editor. This allows analysis to run out-of-process, so that interaction
  remains smooth even for large projects.

* Analysis supports more and better hints, including unused variables and unused
  private members.

[dartfmt]: https://www.dartlang.org/tools/dartfmt/

### Core library changes

#### Highlights

* There's a new model for shared server sockets with no need for a `Socket`
  reference.

* A new, much faster [regular expression engine][regexp].

* The Isolate API now works across the VM and `dart2js`.

[regexp]: http://news.dartlang.org/2015/02/irregexp-dart-vms-new-regexp.html

#### Details

For more information on any of these changes, see the corresponding
documentation on the [Dart API site](http://api.dartlang.org).

* `dart:async`:

  * `Future.wait` added a new named argument, `cleanUp`, which is a callback
    that releases resources allocated by a successful `Future`.

  * The `SynchronousStreamController` class was added as an explicit name for
    the type returned when the `sync` argument is passed to `new
    StreamController`.

* `dart:collection`: The `new SplayTreeSet.from(Iterable)` constructor was
  added.

* `dart:convert`: `Utf8Encoder.convert` and `Utf8Decoder.convert` added optional
  `start` and `end` arguments.

* `dart:core`:

  * `RangeError` added new static helper functions: `checkNotNegative`,
    `checkValidIndex`, `checkValidRange`, and `checkValueInInterval`.

  * `int` added the `modPow` function.

  * `String` added the `replaceFirstMapped` and `replaceRange` functions.

* `dart:io`:

  * Support for locking files to prevent concurrent modification was added. This
    includes the `File.lock`, `File.lockSync`, `File.unlock`, and
    `File.unlockSync` functions as well as the `FileLock` class.

  * Support for starting detached processes by passing the named `mode` argument
    (a `ProcessStartMode`) to `Process.start`. A process can be fully attached,
    fully detached, or detached except for its standard IO streams.

  * `HttpServer.bind` and `HttpServer.bindSecure` added the `v6Only` named
    argument. If this is true, only IPv6 connections will be accepted.

  * `HttpServer.bind`, `HttpServer.bindSecure`, `ServerSocket.bind`,
    `RawServerSocket.bind`, `SecureServerSocket.bind` and
    `RawSecureServerSocket.bind` added the `shared` named argument. If this is
    true, multiple servers or sockets in the same Dart process may bind to the
    same address, and incoming requests will automatically be distributed
    between them.

  * **Deprecation:** the experimental `ServerSocketReference` and
    `RawServerSocketReference` classes, as well as getters that returned them,
    are marked as deprecated. The `shared` named argument should be used
    instead. These will be removed in Dart 1.10.

  * `Socket.connect` and `RawSocket.connect` added the `sourceAddress` named
    argument, which specifies the local address to bind when making a
    connection.

  * The static `Process.killPid` method was added to kill a process with a given
    PID.

  * `Stdout` added the `nonBlocking` instance property, which returns a
    non-blocking `IOSink` that writes to standard output.

* `dart:isolate`:

  * The static getter `Isolate.current` was added.

  * The `Isolate` methods `addOnExitListener`, `removeOnExitListener`,
    `setErrorsFatal`, `addOnErrorListener`, and `removeOnErrorListener` now work
    on the VM.

  * Isolates spawned via `Isolate.spawn` now allow most objects, including
    top-level and static functions, to be sent between them.

## 1.8.5 – 2015-01-21

* Code generation for SIMD on ARM and ARM64 is fixed.

* A possible crash on MIPS with newer GCC toolchains has been prevented.

* A segfault when using `rethrow` was fixed ([issue 21795][]).

[issue 21795]: https://code.google.com/p/dart/issues/detail?id=21795

## 1.8.3 – 2014-12-10

* Breakpoints can be set in the Editor using file suffixes ([issue 21280][]).

* IPv6 addresses are properly handled by `HttpClient` in `dart:io`, fixing a
  crash in pub ([issue 21698][]).

* Issues with the experimental `async`/`await` syntax have been fixed.

* Issues with a set of number operations in the VM have been fixed.

* `ListBase` in `dart:collection` always returns an `Iterable` with the correct
  type argument.

[issue 21280]: https://code.google.com/p/dart/issues/detail?id=21280
[issue 21698]: https://code.google.com/p/dart/issues/detail?id=21698

## 1.8.0 – 2014-11-28

* `dart:collection`: `SplayTree` added the `toSet` function.

* `dart:convert`: The `JsonUtf8Encoder` class was added.

* `dart:core`:

  * The `IndexError` class was added for errors caused by an index being outside
    its expected range.

  * The `new RangeError.index` constructor was added. It forwards to `new
    IndexError`.

  * `RangeError` added three new properties. `invalidProperty` is the value that
    caused the error, and `start` and `end` are the minimum and maximum values
    that the value is allowed to assume.

  * `new RangeError.value` and `new RangeError.range` added an optional
    `message` argument.

  * The `new String.fromCharCodes` constructor added optional `start` and `end`
    arguments.

* `dart:io`:

  * Support was added for the [Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation][alpn]
    extension to the TLS protocol for both the client and server.

  * `SecureSocket.connect`, `SecureServerSocket.bind`,
    `RawSecureSocket.connect`, `RawSecureSocket.secure`,
    `RawSecureSocket.secureServer`, and `RawSecureServerSocket.bind` added a
    `supportedProtocols` named argument for protocol negotiation.

  * `RawSecureServerSocket` added a `supportedProtocols` field.

  * `RawSecureSocket` and `SecureSocket` added a `selectedProtocol` field which
    contains the protocol selected during protocol negotiation.

[alpn]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7301

## 1.7.0 – 2014-10-15

### Tool changes

* `pub` now generates binstubs for packages that are globally activated so that
  they can be put on the user's `PATH` and used as normal executables. See the
  [`pub global activate` documentation][pub global activate].

* When using `dart2js`, deferred loading now works with multiple Dart apps on
  the same page.

[pub global activate]: https://www.dartlang.org/tools/pub/cmd/pub-global.html#running-a-script-from-your-path

### Core library changes

* `dart:async`: `Zone`, `ZoneDelegate`, and `ZoneSpecification` added the
  `errorCallback` function, which allows errors that have been programmatically
  added to a `Future` or `Stream` to be intercepted.

* `dart:io`:

  * **Breaking change:** `HttpClient.close` must be called for all clients or
    they will keep the Dart process alive until they time out. This fixes the
    handling of persistent connections. Previously, the client would shut down
    immediately after a request.

  * **Breaking change:** `HttpServer` no longer compresses all traffic by
    default. The new `autoCompress` property can be set to `true` to re-enable
    compression.

* `dart:isolate`: `Isolate.spawnUri` added the optional `packageRoot` argument,
  which controls how it resolves `package:` URIs.
