# Dart

## An approachable, portable, and productive language for high-quality apps on any platform

Dart is:

  * **Approachable**:
  Develop with a strongly typed programming language that is consistent,
  concise, and offers modern language features like null safety and patterns.

  * **Portable**:
  Compile to ARM, x64, or RISC-V machine code for mobile, desktop, and backend.
  Compile to JavaScript or WebAssembly for the web.

  * **Productive**:
  Make changes iteratively: use hot reload to see the result instantly in your running app.
  Diagnose app issues using [DevTools](https://dart.dev/tools/dart-devtools).

Dart's flexible compiler technology lets you run Dart code in different ways,
depending on your target platform and goals:

  * **Dart Native**: For programs targeting devices (mobile, desktop, server, and more),
  Dart Native includes both a Dart VM with JIT (just-in-time) compilation and an
  AOT (ahead-of-time) compiler for producing machine code.

  * **Dart Web**: For programs targeting the web, Dart Web includes both a development time
  compiler (dartdevc) and a production time compiler (dart2js).
