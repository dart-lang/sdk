This directory contains a stable Dart SDK, which is used to build the
observatory and to run the test scripts.

The DEPS use CIPD's ${platform} syntax find the right SDK for the platform.

We are currently using the 32-bit ia32 build as the default on Windows, and the
64-bit x64 build as the default on Linux and Mac. arm and arm64 CIPD packages
are used on Linux.

To upload new versions of these CIPD packages, run "./update.sh" in this
directory. Because these SDKs are used for the presubmit dartfmt check on
changed files, they may need to be updated often when dartfmt is changing
rapidly. Access to the project-dart-admins Luci auth group is required to do so.
