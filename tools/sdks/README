This directory contains a stable Dart SDK, which is used to build the
observatory and to run the test scripts.

The DEPS use CIPD's ${platform} syntax find the right SDK for the platform.

We use the x64 build as the default on Linux, Mac and Windows. Builds for Linux
on ARM and ARM64 are also provided.

The SDK can be updated to a release commit from dev/beta/stable using:

    gclient setdep --var="sdk_tag=git_revision:$commit"

Because these SDKs are used for the presubmit dart format check on changed
files, they may need to be updated often when dart format is changing rapidly.
