This directory contains a stable Dart SDK, which is used to build the
observatory and to run the test scripts.

The DEPS use CIPD's ${platform} syntax find the right SDK for the platform.

We use the x64 build as the default on Linux, Mac and Windows. Builds for Linux
on ARM and ARM64 are also provided.

To upload new versions of these CIPD packages, run "./update.sh" in this
directory. Because these SDKs are used for the presubmit dartfmt check on
changed files, they may need to be updated often when dartfmt is changing
rapidly. Access to the project-dart-admins Luci auth group is required to do so.
