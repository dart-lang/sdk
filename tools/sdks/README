This directory contains a stable Dart SDK, which is used to bootstrap the Dart
SDK build and to run the test scripts.

The DEPS use CIPD's ${platform} syntax find the right SDK for the platform.

The SDK can be updated to a release commit from dev/beta/stable using:

    gclient setdep --var="sdk_tag=git_revision:$commit"

Because these SDKs are used for the presubmit dart format check on changed
files, they may need to be updated often when dart format is changing rapidly.
