/**
 * A custom KeyboardEvent that attempts to eliminate cross-browser
 * inconsistencies, and also provide both keyCode and charCode information
 * for all key events (when such information can be determined).
 *
 * KeyEvent tries to provide a higher level, more polished keyboard event
 * information on top of the "raw" [KeyboardEvent].
 *
 * The mechanics of using KeyEvents is a little different from the underlying
 * [KeyboardEvent]. To use KeyEvents, you need to create a stream and then add
 * KeyEvents to the stream, rather than using the [EventTarget.dispatchEvent].
 * Here's an example usage:
 *
 *     // Initialize a stream for the KeyEvents:
 *     var stream = KeyEvent.keyPressEvent.forTarget(document.body);
 *     // Start listening to the stream of KeyEvents.
 *     stream.listen((keyEvent) =>
 *         window.console.log('KeyPress event detected ${keyEvent.charCode}'));
 *     ...
 *     // Add a new KeyEvent of someone pressing the 'A' key to the stream so
 *     // listeners can know a KeyEvent happened.
 *     stream.add(new KeyEvent('keypress', keyCode: 65, charCode: 97));
 *
 * This class is very much a work in progress, and we'd love to get information
 * on how we can make this class work with as many international keyboards as
 * possible. Bugs welcome!
