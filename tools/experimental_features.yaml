# Experimental features are described in docs/process/experimental-flags.md
# (Despite the name, they are not really intended for experiments.)
# They are intended to enable new features or enhancements that are being
# developed and are not yet shipped. Experimental feature flags are expected
# to be relatively short-lived.
#
# ### Code Generation
#
# When you change this file, run the following to update analyzer, kernel, and
# vm:
#
# analyzer:
#   dart pkg/analyzer/tool/experiments/generate.dart
#
# kernel:
#   pkg/front_end/tool/fasta generate-experimental-flags
#
# vm:
#   dart tools/generate_experimental_flags.dart
#
# ### Overview
#
# This document consists mostly of a map called "features".
# Each entry in this map corresponds to an experiment,
# and contains the following parts:
#
# 1. help: (required text)
#    A human readable description of the experiment.
#
# 2. enabledIn: (optional #.#)
#    The Dart SDK version (<major>.<minor>) in which the experiment is shipping.
#
#    If this field is specified, then the experiment is enabled regardless of
#    the actual version of the SDK. If this field is omitted, then the
#    experiment is disabled by default, but may be enabled by specifying the
#    flag on the command line. (e.g. --enable-experiment=non-nullable)
#
#    A version less than this version may be specified in a .packages file
#    or in a library language version override (e.g. // @dart = 2.1)
#    to disable this feature. For more on library language version override, see
#    https://github.com/dart-lang/language/blob/master/accepted/future-releases/language-versioning/language-versioning.md
#
# 3. expired: (optional boolean)
#    If true, then the experiment can no longer be enabled by specifying the
#    flag on the command line, and the corresponding entry is slated for
#    eventual removal from this file. If this field is omitted, then 'expired'
#    is considered to be false.
#
# 4. validation: (optional string)
#    If provided this should be a program that prints "feature enabled" on
#    stdout if the feature is enabled, and throws or fails to compile otherwise.
#    The intended use for this is to be able to run generic tests for each
#    experiment.
#
# Using the above fields, experiments pass through several states:
#
# Disabled:
#    When an experiment is first added to this file, the 'enabledIn' and
# 'expired' fields are omitted and the experiment is disabled by default,
# but may be enabled by specifying the flag on the command line.
# The implementation teams begin building support for the feature,
# guarded by the flag.  Users can enable the flag and begin to try out
# the feature as it is being developed.
#
# Experimental release:
#    When an experiment is released, then the 'experimentalReleaseVersion' field
# is added indicating which version of the SDK contains this new language
# feature for libraries and packages in mentioned in
# `sdk/lib/_internal/allowed_experiments.json`. For other libraries and
# packages, passing the experiment flag is still required to turn on the
# experiment.
#
# Shipped:
#    When an experiment is shipped, then the 'enabledIn' field is added
# indicating which version of the SDK contains this new language feature.
# At this point, specifying the flag on the command line has no effect because
# the experiment is enabled by default and cannot be disabled.
#
# Retired or Rejected:
#    At some point, the 'expired' field is added to the experiment indicating
# that the flag is to be retired if the experiment has shipped or that the
# entire experiment was rejected if the experiment has not shipped. It also
# indicates that the corresponding entry is slated for eventual removal
# from this file. Users specifying this flag on the command line should receive
# a warning that the experiment has been retired or rejected, but the tool
# should continue to run.
#
# In addition, there is also a value called "current-version"
# specifying the version of Dart that is currently being developed.
# Dart source files that don't specify their own version will be
# presumed to be in this version.  Experiment flags will not affect
# files that specify an earlier version.
#
# Furthermore, most of the above was designed with language features
# (spanning both CFE and Analyzer) in mind, but didn't take into account
# features in individual products (e.g. in CFE that has no influence on
# Analyzer). As a stepping-stone to allow for this usage as well, a "category"
# is also available. If no "category" is specified it's assumed to be the
# default 'language' "category" with code generated for both CFE and Analyzer,
# while other categories can be tailored more specifically.
