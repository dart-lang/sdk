Welcome to the [Dart](https://dart.dev/) API reference documentation, covering
the [Dart core libraries](https://dart.dev/guides/libraries). These include:
   
  * [dart:core](dart-core/dart-core-library.html): Core functionality such as
    strings, numbers, collections, errors, dates, and URIs.
  * [dart:html](dart-html/dart-html-library.html): DOM manipulation for web apps
    (available only to web apps).
  * [dart:io](dart-io/dart-io-library.html): I/O for non-web apps.
  
Except for `dart:core`, you must import a library before you can use it. Here's
an example of importing `dart:async` and `dart:math`:

```dart
import 'dart:async';
import 'dart:math';
```

You can find more libraries using the [pub.dev site](https://pub.dev).
