Description:
A JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data.

Subject to the security patch(es) described below, you MAY include d3 in web-facing content, such
as in pages generated by bots or tools.


Local Modifications:
1. Deleted everything except for:
* d3.js         the standalone non-minified library
* LICENSE       the BSD-style 3-Clause license
* README.md     the readme file from github, for basic information

2. Applied the following patches at the request of security:
patches/001_no_html.patch        Disables the html() convenience functions, which could be used to
                                 inject arbitrary content into the page. Instead of using html(),
                                 programmatically create the individual nodes and/or text that you
                                 require.
                                 The html() methods have been modified to throw exceptions that
                                 make it obvious that this feature is disabled for security.
