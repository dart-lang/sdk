Description:
This directory contains hashes of the d8 binaries for Windows, Mac and Linux.
The files are stored in cloud storage in the bucket dart-dependencies,
and are downloaded by the depot_tools tool download_from_cloud_storage.py.
The files were fetched from the v8 builders on the DartFYI waterfall:
http://build.chromium.org/p/client.dart.fyi/console

When all users are updated to use linux binaries from the ia32 or other
subdirectories, remove them from d8/linux.
Build and add an ARMv8 64-bit build on linux.

The binaries are used for testing dart code compiled to javascript.
