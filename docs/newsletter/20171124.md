Welcome to the Dart Language and Library Newsletter.

It is with some regret that I'm announcing the end of the Dart Language and Library Newsletter (at least written by me). Since Monday I am not on the language team anymore, and it would be unfair and manipulative to continue discussing language features. As a member of the Dart team, public comments and discussions do set the tone and raise expectations. While the newsletter usually avoided promises, I generally talked about features that I, as the tech lead, had influence over. I want to give the new team the same opportunity and give them the room to set their own direction.

Writing the newsletters took me some time, but the positive feedback kept me going. Thank you all for the kind words I received.
