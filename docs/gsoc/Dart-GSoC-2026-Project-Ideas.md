## Project Application Process
All projects assume familiarity with Dart (and sometimes Flutter). Aspiring applicants are encouraged to [learn Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour) and try to write some code.

Applicants are welcome to find and fix bugs in [Dart](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk) or some of the [packages written by the Dart team](https://pub.dev/publishers/dart.dev/packages). However, getting reviews can take a long time as code owners may be busy working on new features. So instead of requiring applicants to fix a _good first bug_, we
suggest that applicants write a working code sample relevant for the proposed project.

The code sample can be attached to the application as a [**secret** gist](https://gist.github.com/) (please use _secret gists_, and do not share these with other applicants). Suggested ideas below includes proposed "Good Sample Projects".

**Do not spend too much energy on this piece of sample code**, we just want to see
that you can code something relevant -- and that this sample code can run and do something non-trivial. Be aware that we have a limited number of
mentors available, and will only be able to accept a few applicants.

Applications can be submitted through the [summerofcode.withgoogle.com](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) website. Applicants are encouraged to submit draft proposals, linking to Google Docs with permission for mentors to comment. See also the [contributor guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal) on writing a proposal.

**IMPORTANT**: Remember to submit _final proposals_ before [the April 8th deadline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline).
