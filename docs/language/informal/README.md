## Background material about features

This directory contains background material only. Consult the 
[language specification](https://dart.dev/guides/language/spec)
and the 
[language repository](https://github.com/dart-lang/language)
for current information.

### What is a feature specification?

In order to move faster and get better feedback, we implement and iterate on
language changes before the full official specification has been written.
Still, the implementers need *something* to go on.

For that, the language team writes _feature specifications_. These are
intended to be precise enough for a good faith implementer to correctly
understand the syntax and semantics of the language, but when the contents
of a feature specification is integrated into the language specification we
expect the extra processing to give rise to additional clarifications and
corrections, which means that a feature specification is expected to be 
_nearly_ as complete and correct as the language specification.

### Feature specifications in this directory

This directory contains older feature specifications, newer ones can be
found in, respectively should be submitted to, the language repository
[here](https://github.com/dart-lang/language).

The status of every feature specification in this directory is that it is
background material, and the contents has been integrated into the language
specification. Consequently, these feature specifications can only be used
as a source of informal background information. Precise rules about the
features should be looked up in the language specification.
