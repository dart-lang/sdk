# Welcome!

Welcome to the Dart API reference documentation, covering the
[Dart core libraries](https://dart.dev/guides/libraries). These include:
   
  * [dart:core](dart-core/dart-core-library.html): Core functionality such as
    strings, numbers, collections, errors, dates, and URIs.
  * [dart:io](dart-io/dart-io-library.html): I/O for non-web apps.
  * [dart:html](dart-html/dart-html-library.html): DOM manipulation for web apps
    (available only to web apps).
  
For most of the core libraries - except for `dart:core` - need to imported
before they're available for use. For example:

```dart
import 'dart:math';
```

Additionally, you can find Dart packages at [pub.dev](https://pub.dev).
