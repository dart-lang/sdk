/**
 * A server that delivers content, such as web pages, using the HTTP protocol.
 *
 * The HttpServer is a [Stream] that provides [HttpRequest] objects. Each
 * HttpRequest has an associated [HttpResponse] object.
 * The server responds to a request by writing to that HttpResponse object.
 * The following example shows how to bind an HttpServer to an IPv6
 * [InternetAddress] on port 80 (the standard port for HTTP servers)
 * and how to listen for requests.
 * Port 80 is the default HTTP port. However, on most systems accessing
 * this requires super-user privileges. For local testing consider
 * using a non-reserved port (1024 and above).
 *
 *     import 'dart:io';
 *
 *     main() {
 *       HttpServer
 *           .bind(InternetAddress.ANY_IP_V6, 80)
 *           .then((server) {
 *             server.listen((HttpRequest request) {
 *               request.response.write('Hello, world!');
 *               request.response.close();
 *             });
 *           });
 *     }
 *
 * Incomplete requests, in which all or part of the header is missing, are
 * ignored, and no exceptions or HttpRequest objects are generated for them.
 * Likewise, when writing to an HttpResponse, any [Socket] exceptions are
 * ignored and any future writes are ignored.
 *
 * The HttpRequest exposes the request headers and provides the request body,
 * if it exists, as a Stream of data. If the body is unread, it is drained
 * when the server writes to the HttpResponse or closes it.
 *
 * ## Bind with a secure HTTPS connection
 *
 * Use [bindSecure] to create an HTTPS server.
 *
 * The server presents a certificate to the client. The certificate
 * chain and the private key are set in the [SecurityContext]
 * object that is passed to [bindSecure].
 *
 *     import 'dart:io';
 *     import "dart:isolate";
 *
 *     main() {
 *       SecurityContext context = new SecurityContext();
 *       var chain =
 *           Platform.script.resolve('certificates/server_chain.pem')
 *           .toFilePath();
 *       var key =
 *           Platform.script.resolve('certificates/server_key.pem')
 *           .toFilePath();
 *       context.useCertificateChain(chain);
 *       context.usePrivateKey(key, password: 'dartdart');
 *
 *       HttpServer
 *           .bindSecure(InternetAddress.ANY_IP_V6,
 *                       443,
 *                       context)
 *           .then((server) {
 *             server.listen((HttpRequest request) {
 *               request.response.write('Hello, world!');
 *               request.response.close();
 *             });
 *           });
 *     }
 *
 *  The certificates and keys are PEM files, which can be created and
 *  managed with the tools in OpenSSL.
 *
 * ## Connect to a server socket
 *
 * You can use the [listenOn] constructor to attach an HTTP server to
 * a [ServerSocket].
 *
 *     import 'dart:io';
 *
 *     main() {
 *       ServerSocket.bind(InternetAddress.ANY_IP_V6, 80)
 *         .then((serverSocket) {
 *           HttpServer httpserver = new HttpServer.listenOn(serverSocket);
 *           serverSocket.listen((Socket socket) {
 *             socket.write('Hello, client.');
 *           });
 *         });
 *     }
 *
 * ## Other resources
 *
 * * HttpServer is a Stream. Refer to the [Stream] class for information
 * about the streaming qualities of an HttpServer.
 * Pausing the subscription of the stream, pauses at the OS level.
 *
 * * The [http_server](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/http_server)
 * package on pub.dartlang.org contains a set of high-level classes that,
 * together with this class, makes it easy to provide content through HTTP
 * servers.

 * dart:io HTTP server subsystem easier.
 *
 * `HttpRequest` objects are generated by an [HttpServer],
 * which listens for HTTP requests on a specific host and port.
 * For each request received, the HttpServer, which is a [Stream],
 * generates an `HttpRequest` object and adds it to the stream.
 *
 * An `HttpRequest` object delivers the body content of the request
 * as a stream of byte lists.
 * The object also contains information about the request,
 * such as the method, URI, and headers.
 *
 * In the following code, an HttpServer listens
 * for HTTP requests. When the server receives a request,
 * it uses the HttpRequest object's `method` property to dispatch requests.
 *

 *

/**
 * A client that receives content, such as web pages, from
 * a server using the HTTP protocol.
 *
 * HttpClient contains a number of methods to send an [HttpClientRequest]
 * to an Http server and receive an [HttpClientResponse] back.
 * For example, you can use the [get], [getUrl], [post], and [postUrl] methods
 * for GET and POST requests, respectively.
 *
 * ## Making a simple GET request: an example
 *
 * A `getUrl` request is a two-step process, triggered by two [Future]s.
 * When the first future completes with a [HttpClientRequest], the underlying
 * network connection has been established, but no data has been sent.
 * In the callback function for the first future, the HTTP headers and body
 * can be set on the request. Either the first write to the request object
 * or a call to [close] sends the request to the server.
 *
 * When the HTTP response is received from the server,
 * the second future, which is returned by close,
 * completes with an [HttpClientResponse] object.
 * This object provides access to the headers and body of the response.
 * The body is available as a stream implemented by HttpClientResponse.
 * If a body is present, it must be read. Otherwise, it leads to resource
 * leaks. Consider using [HttpClientResponse.drain] if the body is unused.
 *
 *     HttpClient client = new HttpClient();
 *     client.getUrl(Uri.parse("http://www.example.com/"))
 *         .then((HttpClientRequest request) {
 *           // Optionally set up headers...
 *           // Optionally write to the request object...
 *           // Then call close.
 *           ...
 *           return request.close();
 *         })
 *         .then((HttpClientResponse response) {
 *           // Process the response.
 *           ...
 *         });
 *
 * The future for [HttpClientRequest] is created by methods such as
 * [getUrl] and [open].
 *
 * ## HTTPS connections
 *
 * An HttpClient can make HTTPS requests, connecting to a server using
 * the TLS (SSL) secure networking protocol. Calling [getUrl] with an
 * https: scheme will work automatically, if the server's certificate is
 * signed by a root CA (certificate authority) on the default list of
 * well-known trusted CAs, compiled by Mozilla.
 *
 * To add a custom trusted certificate authority, or to send a client
 * certificate to servers that request one, pass a [SecurityContext] object
 * as the optional [context] argument to the `HttpClient` constructor.
 * The desired security options can be set on the [SecurityContext] object.
 *
 * ## Headers
 *
 * All HttpClient requests set the following header by default:
 *
 *     Accept-Encoding: gzip
 *
 * This allows the HTTP server to use gzip compression for the body if
 * possible. If this behavior is not desired set the
 * `Accept-Encoding` header to something else.
 * To turn off gzip compression of the response, clear this header:
 *
 *      request.headers.removeAll(HttpHeaders.ACCEPT_ENCODING)
 *
 * ## Closing the HttpClient
 *
 * The HttpClient supports persistent connections and caches network
 * connections to reuse them for multiple requests whenever
 * possible. This means that network connections can be kept open for
 * some time after a request has completed. Use HttpClient.close
 * to force the HttpClient object to shut down and to close the idle
 * network connections.
 *
 * ## Turning proxies on and off
 *
 * By default the HttpClient uses the proxy configuration available
 * from the environment, see [findProxyFromEnvironment]. To turn off
 * the use of proxies set the [findProxy] property to
 * [:null:].
 *
 *     HttpClient client = new HttpClient();
 *     client.findProxy = null;
