/**
 * An isolated Dart execution context.
 *
 * All Dart code runs in an isolate, and code can access classes and values
 * only from the same isolate. Different isolates can communicate by sending
 * values through ports (see [ReceivePort], [SendPort]).
 *
 * An `Isolate` object is a reference to an isolate, usually different from
 * the current isolate.
 * It represents, and can be used to control, the other isolate.
 *
 * When spawning a new isolate, the spawning isolate receives an `Isolate`
 * object representing the new isolate when the spawn operation succeeds.
 *
 * Isolates run code in its own event loop, and each event may run smaller tasks
 * in a nested microtask queue.
 *
 * An `Isolate` object allows other isolates to control the event loop
 * of the isolate that it represents, and to inspect the isolate,
 * for example by pausing the isolate or by getting events when the isolate
 * has an uncaught error.
 *
 * The [controlPort] identifies and gives access to controlling the isolate,
 * and the [pauseCapability] and [terminateCapability] guard access
 * to some control operations.
 * For example, calling [pause] on an `Isolate` object created without a
 * [pauseCapability], has no effect.
 *
 * The `Isolate` object provided by a spawn operation will have the
 * control port and capabilities needed to control the isolate.
 * New isolate objects can be created without some of these capabilities
 * if necessary, using the [Isolate.Isolate] constructor.
 *
 * An `Isolate` object cannot be sent over a `SendPort`, but the control port
 * and capabilities can be sent, and can be used to create a new functioning
 * `Isolate` object in the receiving port's isolate.
