/**
 * Synchronously blocks the calling isolate to wait for asynchronous events to
 * complete.
 *
 * If the [timeout] parameter is supplied, [waitForEvent] will return after
 * the specified timeout even if no events have occurred.
 *
 * This call does the following:
 * - suspends the current execution stack,
 * - runs the microtask queue until it is empty,
 * - waits until the message queue is not empty,
 * - handles messages on the message queue, plus their associated microtasks,
 *   until the message queue is empty,
 * - resumes the original stack.
 *
 * This function breaks the usual promise offered by Dart semantics that
 * message handlers and microtasks run to completion before the next message
 * handler or microtask begins to run. Of particular note is that use of this
 * function in a finally block will allow microtasks and message handlers to
 * run before all finally blocks for an exception have completed, possibly
 * breaking invariants in your program.
 *
 * This function will synchronously throw the first unhandled exception it
 * encounters in running the microtasks and message handlers as though the
 * throwing microtask or message handler was the only Dart invocation on the
 * stack. That is, unhandled exceptions in a microtask or message handler will
 * skip over stacks suspended in a call to [waitForEvent].
 *
 * Calls to this function may be nested. Earlier invocations will not
 * be able to complete until subsequent ones do. Messages that arrive after
 * a subsequent invocation are "consumed" by that invocation, and do not
 * unblock an earlier invocation. Please be aware that nesting calls to
 * [waitForEvent] can lead to deadlock when subsequent calls block to wait for
 * a condition that is only satisfied after an earlier call returns.
 *
 * Please note that this call is only available in the standalone command-line
 * Dart VM. Further, because it suspends the current execution stack until the
 * message queue is empty, even when running in the standalone command-line VM
 * there exists a risk that the current execution stack will be starved.

/**
 * Suspends the stack, runs microtasks, and handles incoming events until
 * [future] completes.
 *
 * WARNING: EXPERIMENTAL. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
 *
 * This call does the following:
 * - While [future] is not completed:
 *   - suspends the current execution stack,
 *   - runs the microtask queue until it is empty,
 *   - waits until the message queue is not empty,
 *   - handles messages on the message queue, plus their associated microtasks,
 *     until the message queue is empty,
 *   - resumes the original stack.
 *
 * This function breaks the usual promise offered by Dart semantics that
 * message handlers and microtasks run to completion before the next message
 * handler or microtask begins to run. Of particular note is that use of this
 * function in a finally block will allow microtasks and message handlers to
 * run before all finally blocks for an exception have completed, possibly
 * breaking invariants in your program.
 *
 * Use of this function should be considered a last resort when it is not
 * possible to convert a Dart program entirely to an asynchronous style using
 * `async` and `await`.
 *
 * If the [Future] completes normally, its result is returned. If the [Future]
 * completes with an error, the error and stack trace are wrapped in an
 * [AsyncError] and thrown. If a microtask or message handler run during this
 * call results in an unhandled exception, that exception will be propagated
 * as though the microtask or message handler was the only Dart invocation on
 * the stack. That is, unhandled exceptions in a microtask or message handler
 * will skip over stacks suspended in a call to [waitFor].
 *
 * If the optional `timeout` parameter is passed, [waitFor] throws a
 * [TimeoutException] if the [Future] is not completed within the specified
 * period.
 *
 * Calls to [waitFor] may be nested. Earlier invocations will not complete
 * until subsequent ones do, but the completion of a subsequent invocation will
 * cause the previous invocation to wake up and check its [Future] for
 * completion.
 *
 * Please be aware that nesting calls to [waitFor] can lead to deadlock if
 * subsequent calls block waiting for a condition that is only satisfied when
 * an earlier call returns.
