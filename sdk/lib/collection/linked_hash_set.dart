/// A [LinkedHashSet] is a hash-table based [Set] implementation.
///
/// The `LinkedHashSet` also keep track of the order that elements were inserted
/// in, and iteration happens in first-to-last insertion order.
///
/// The elements of a `LinkedHashSet` must have consistent [Object.==]
/// and [Object.hashCode] implementations. This means that the `==` operator
/// must define a stable equivalence relation on the elements (reflexive,
/// symmetric, transitive, and consistent over time), and that `hashCode`
/// must be the same for objects that are considered equal by `==`.
///
/// Iteration of elements is done in element insertion order.
/// An element that was added after another will occur later in the iteration.
/// Adding an element that is already in the set
/// does not change its position in the iteration order,
/// but removing an element and adding it again,
/// will make it the last element of an iteration.
///
/// Most simple operations on `HashSet` are done in (potentially amortized)
/// constant time: [add], [contains], [remove], and [length], provided the hash
/// codes of objects are well distributed..
abstract class LinkedHashSet<E> implements Set<E> {
  /// Create an insertion-ordered hash set using the provided
  /// [equals] and [hashCode].
  ///
  /// The provided [equals] must define a stable equivalence relation, and
  /// [hashCode] must be consistent with [equals]. If the [equals] or [hashCode]
  /// methods won't work on all objects, but only on some instances of E, the
  /// [isValidKey] predicate can be used to restrict the keys that the functions
  /// are applied to.
  /// Any key for which [isValidKey] returns false is automatically assumed
  /// to not be in the set when asking `contains`.
  ///
  /// If [equals] or [hashCode] are omitted, the set uses
  /// the elements' intrinsic [Object.==] and [Object.hashCode],
  /// and [isValidKey] is ignored since these operations are assumed
  /// to work on all objects.
  ///
  /// If you supply one of [equals] and [hashCode],
  /// you should generally also to supply the other.
  ///
  /// If the supplied `equals` or `hashCode` functions won't work on all [E]
  /// objects, and the map will be used in a setting where a non-`E` object
  /// is passed to, e.g., `contains`, then the [isValidKey] function should
  /// also be supplied.
  ///
  /// If [isValidKey] is omitted, it defaults to testing if the object is an
  /// [E] instance. That means that:
  /// ```dart
  /// LinkedHashSet<int>(equals: (int e1, int e2) => (e1 - e2) % 5 == 0,
  ///                    hashCode: (int e) => e % 5)
  /// ```
  /// does not need an `isValidKey` argument, because it defaults to only
  /// accepting `int` values which are accepted by both `equals` and `hashCode`.
  ///
  /// If neither `equals`, `hashCode`, nor `isValidKey` is provided,
  /// the default `isValidKey` instead accepts all values.
  /// The default equality and hashcode operations are assumed to work on all
  /// objects.
  ///
  /// Likewise, if `equals` is [identical], `hashCode` is [identityHashCode]
  /// and `isValidKey` is omitted, the resulting set is identity based,
  /// and the `isValidKey` defaults to accepting all keys.
  /// Such a map can be created directly using [LinkedHashSet.identity].

  ///
