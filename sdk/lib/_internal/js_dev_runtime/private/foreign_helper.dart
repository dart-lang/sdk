/**
 * Emits a JavaScript code fragment parameterized by arguments.
 *
 * Hash characters `#` in the [codeTemplate] are replaced in left-to-right order
 * with expressions that contain the values of, or evaluate to, the arguments.
 * The number of hash marks must match the number or arguments.  Although
 * declared with arguments [arg0] through [arg2], the form actually has no limit
 * on the number of arguments.
 *
 * The [typeDescription] argument is interpreted as a description of the
 * behavior of the JavaScript code.  Currently it describes the types that may
 * be returned by the expression, with the additional behavior that the returned
 * values may be fresh instances of the types.  The type information must be
 * correct as it is trusted by the compiler in optimizations, and it must be
 * precise as possible since it is used for native live type analysis to
 * tree-shake large parts of the DOM libraries.  If poorly written, the
 * [typeDescription] will cause unnecessarily bloated programs.  (You can check
 * for this by compiling with `--verbose`; there is an info message describing
 * the number of native (DOM) types that can be removed, which usually should be
 * greater than zero.)
 *
 * The [typeDescription] is a [String] which contains a union of types separated
 * by vertical bar `|` symbols, e.g.  `"num|String"` describes the union of
 * numbers and Strings.  There is no type in Dart that is this precise.  The
 * Dart alternative would be `Object` or `dynamic`, but these types imply that
 * the JS-code might also be creating instances of all the DOM types.  If `null`
 * is possible, it must be specified explicitly, e.g. `"String|Null"`.
 * [typeDescription] has several extensions to help describe the behavior more
 * accurately.  In addition to the union type already described:
 *
 *  + `=Object` is a plain JavaScript object.  Some DOM methods return instances
 *     that have no corresponding Dart type (e.g. cross-frame documents),
 *     `=Object` can be used to describe these untyped' values.
 *
 *  + `var` (or empty string).  If the entire [typeDescription] is `var` (or
 *    empty string) then the type is `dynamic` but the code is known to not
 *    create any instances.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 *     // Parent window might be an opaque cross-frame window.
 *     var thing = JS('=Object|Window', '#.parent', myWindow);
 *
 * Guidelines:
 *
 *  + Do not use any parameter, local, method or field names in the
 *    [codeTemplate].  These names are all subject to arbitrary renaming by the
 *    compiler.  Pass the values in via `#` substition, and test with the
 *    `--minify` dart2js command-line option.
 *
 *  + The substituted expressions are values, not locations.
 *
 *        JS('void', '# += "x"', this.field);
 *
 *    `this.field` might not be a substituted as a reference to the field.  The
 *    generated code might accidentally work as intended, but it also might be
 *
 *        var t1 = this.field;
 *        t1 += "x";
 *
 *    or
 *
 *        this.get$field() += "x";
 *
 *    The remedy in this case is to expand the `+=` operator, leaving all
 *    references to the Dart field as Dart code:
 *
 *        this.field = JS<String>('!', '# + "x"', this.field);
 *
 *  + Never use `#` in function bodies.
 *
 *    This is a variation on the previous guideline.  Since `#` is replaced with
 *    an *expression* and the expression is only valid in the immediate context,
 *    `#` should never appear in a function body.  Doing so might defer the
 *    evaluation of the expression, and its side effects, until the function is
 *    called.
 *
 *    For example,
 *
 *        var value = foo();
 *        var f = JS('', 'function(){return #}', value)
 *
 *    might result in no immediate call to `foo` and a call to `foo` on every
 *    call to the JavaScript function bound to `f`.  This is better:
 *
 *        var f = JS('',
 *            '(function(val) { return function(){return val}; })(#)', value);
 *
 *    Since `#` occurs in the immediately evaluated expression, the expression
 *    is immediately evaluated and bound to `val` in the immediate call.
 *
 *
 * Additional notes.
 *
 * In the future we may extend [typeDescription] to include other aspects of the
 * behavior, for example, separating the returned types from the instantiated
 * types, or including effects to allow the compiler to perform more
 * optimizations around the code.  This might be an extension of [JS] or a new
 * function similar to [JS] with additional arguments for the new information.
