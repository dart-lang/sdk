///
/// An `Expando` does not hold on to the added property value after an object
/// becomes inaccessible.
///
/// Since you can always create a new number that is identical to an existing
/// number, it means that an expando property on a number could never be
/// released. To avoid this, expando properties cannot be added to numbers.
/// The same argument applies to strings, booleans and `null`, which also have
/// literals that evaluate to identical values when they occur more than once.
///
/// There is no restriction on other classes, even for compile time constant
/// objects. Be careful if adding expando properties to compile time constants,
/// since they will stay alive forever.

/// which are part of the attachment.
///
/// When a Dart value becomes inaccessible to the program,
/// any finalizer that currently has an attachment to
/// the value *may* have its callback function called
/// with the attachment's finalization token.
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart template:none
/// // Keep the finalizer itself reachable, otherwise might not do anything.
/// final Finalizer<DBConnection> _finalizer = Finalizer((connection) {
///   connection.close();
/// });
///
/// /// Access the database.

///   // Wraps the connection in a nicer user-facing API,
///   // *and* closes connection if the user forgets to.

///   var wrapper = Database._fromConnection(connection, _finalizer);
///   // Get finalizer callback when `wrapper` is no longer reachable.
///   _finalizer.attach(wrapper, connection, detach: wrapper);

/// class Database {

///   final Finalizer<Connection> _finalizer;

///   // Some useful methods.

///     // User requested close.
///     _connection.close();
///     // Detach from finalizer, no longer needed.
///     _finalizer.detach(this);
///   }

/// This example has an example of an external resource that needs clean-up.
/// The finalizer is used to clean up an external connection when the
/// user of the API no longer has access to that connection.
/// The example uses the same object as attached object and detach key,
/// which is a useful approach when each attached object can be detached
/// individually. Being a detachment key doesn't keep an object alive.
///
/// No promises are made that the callback will ever be called.
/// The only thing that is guaranteed is that if a finalizer's callback
/// is called with a specific finalization token as argument,
/// then at least one value with an attachment to to the finalizer
/// that has that finalization token,
/// is no longer accessible to the program.
///
/// If the finalzier *itself* becomes unreachable,
/// it's allowed to be garbage collected
/// and then it won't trigger any further callbacks.
/// Always make sure to keep the finalizer itself reachable while it's needed.
///
/// If multiple finalizers are attached to a single object,
/// or the same finalizer is attached multiple times to an object,
/// and that object becomes inaccessible to the program,
/// then any number (including zero) of those attachments may trigger
/// their associated finalizer's callback.
/// It will not necessarily be all or none of them.
///
/// Finalization callbacks will happen as *events*.
/// They will not happen during execution of other code,
/// and not as a microtask,
/// but as high-level events similar to timer events.
///
/// Finalization callbacks must not throw.
