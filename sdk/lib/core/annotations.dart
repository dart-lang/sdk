/// The annotation `@Deprecated('migration')` marks a feature as deprecated.
///
/// The annotation [deprecated] is a shorthand for deprecating until
/// an unspecified "next release" without migration instructions.
///
/// A feature can be any part of an API, from a full library to a single
/// parameter.
///
/// The intent of the `@Deprecated` annotation is to inform authors
/// who are currently using the feature,
/// that they will soon need to stop using that feature in their code,
/// even if the feature is currently still working correctly.
///
/// Deprecation is an early warning that the deprecated feature
/// is scheduled to be removed at a later time,
/// a time possibly specified in [message].
/// A deprecated feature should no longer be used,
/// code using it will break at some point in the future.
/// If existing code is using the feature,
/// that code should be rewritten to no longer use the deprecated feature.
///
/// A deprecated feature should document how the same effect can be achieved in
/// [message], so the programmer knows how to rewrite the code.
///
/// The `@Deprecated` annotation applies to libraries, top-level declarations
/// (variables, getters, setters, functions, classes, mixins,
/// extension and typedefs),
/// class-level declarations (variables, getters, setters, methods, operators or
/// constructors, whether static or not), named optional parameters and
/// trailing optional positional parameters.
///
/// Deprecation applies transitively to parts of a deprecated feature:
///
///  - If a library is deprecated, so is every member of it.
///  - If a class is deprecated, so is every member of it.
///  - If a variable is deprecated, so are its implicit getter and setter.
///
/// If a feature is deprecated in a superclass, it is *not* automatically
/// deprecated in a subclass as well. It is reasonable to remove a member
/// from a superclass and retain it in a subclass, so it needs to be possible
/// to deprecate the member only in the superclass.
///
/// A tool that processes Dart source code may report when:
///
/// - the code imports a deprecated library.
/// - the code exports a deprecated library, or any deprecated member of
///   a non-deprecated library.
/// - the code refers statically to a deprecated declaration.
/// - the code uses a member of an object with a statically known
///   type, where the member is deprecated on the interface of the static type.
/// - the code calls a method with an argument where the
///   corresponding optional parameter is deprecated on the object's static type.
///
/// If the deprecated use is inside a library, class or method which is itself
/// deprecated, the tool should not bother the user about it.
/// A deprecated feature is expected to use other deprecated features.

/// it means that the variable's implicit getter and setter (if any)
