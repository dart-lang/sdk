/**
 * A regular expression pattern.
 *
 * Regular expressions are [Pattern]s, and can as such be used to match strings
 * or parts of strings.
 *
 * Dart regular expressions have the same syntax and semantics as
 * JavaScript regular expressions. See
 * <http://ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.10>
 * for the specification of JavaScript regular expressions.
 *
 * [firstMatch] is the main implementation method that applies a regular
 * expression to a string and returns the first [Match]. All
 * other methods in [RegExp] can build on it.
 *
 * Use [allMatches] to look for all matches of a regular expression in
 * a string.
 *
 * The following example finds all matches of a regular expression in
 * a string.
 * ```dart
 * RegExp exp = new RegExp(r"(\w+)");
 * String str = "Parse my string";
 * Iterable<Match> matches = exp.allMatches(str);
 * ```
 *
 * Note the use of a _raw string_ (a string prefixed with `r`)
 * in the example above. Use a raw string to treat each character in a string
 * as a literal character.
 */
abstract class RegExp implements Pattern {
  /**
   * Constructs a regular expression.
   *
   * Throws a [FormatException] if [source] is not valid regular
   * expression syntax.
   *
   * If `multiLine` is enabled, then `^` and `$` will match the beginning and
   * end of a _line_, in addition to matching beginning and end of input,
   * respectively.
   *
   * If `caseSensitive` is disabled, then case is ignored.
   *
   * Example:
   *
   * ```dart
   * var wordPattern = RegExp(r"(\w+)");
   * var bracketedNumberValue = RegExp("$key: \\[\\d+\\]");
   * ```
   *
   * Notice the use of a _raw string_ in the first example, and a regular
   * string in the second. Because of the many character classes used in
   * regular expressions, it is common to use a raw string here, unless string
   * interpolation is required.
