/**
 * A collection of objects in which each object can occur only once.
 *
 * That is, for each object of the element type, the object is either considered
 * to be in the set, or to _not_ be in the set.
 *
 * Set implementations may consider some elements indistinguishable. These
 * elements are treated as being the same for any operation on the set.
 *
 * The default [Set] implementation, [LinkedHashSet], considers objects
 * indistinguishable if they are equal with regard to
 * operator [Object.==].
 *
 * Iterating over elements of a set may be either unordered
 * or ordered in some way. Examples:
 *
 * * A [HashSet] is unordered, which means that its iteration order is
 *   uspecified,
 * * [LinkedHashSet] iterates in the insertion order of its elements, and
 * * a sorted set like [SplayTreeSet] iterates the elements in sorted order.
 *
 * It is generally not allowed to modify the set (add or remove elements) while
 * an operation on the set is being performed, for example during a call to
 * [forEach] or [containsAll]. Nor is it allowed to modify the set while
 * iterating either the set itself or any [Iterable] that is backed by the set,
 * such as the ones returned by methods like [where] and [map].
