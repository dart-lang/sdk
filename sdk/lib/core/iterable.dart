/**
 * A collection of values, or "elements", that can be accessed sequentially.
 *
 * The elements of the iterable are accessed by getting an [Iterator]
 * using the [iterator] getter, and using it to step through the values.
 * Stepping with the iterator is done by calling [Iterator.moveNext],
 * and if the call returns `true`,
 * the iterator has now moved to the next element,
 * which is then available as [Iterator.current].
 * If the call returns `false`, there are no more elements,
 * and `iterator.current` returns `null`.
 *
 * You can create more than one iterator from the same `Iterable`.
 * Each time `iterator` is read, it returns a new iterator,
 * and different iterators can be stepped through independently,
 * each giving access to all the elements of the iterable.
 * The iterators of the same iterable *should* provide the same values
 * in the same order (unless the underlying collection is modified between
 * the iterations, which some collections allow).
 *
 * You can also iterate over the elements of an `Iterable`
 * using the for-in loop construct, which uses the `iterator` getter behind the
 * scenes.
 * For example, you can iterate over all of the keys of a [Map],
 * because `Map` keys are iterable.
 *
 *     Map kidsBooks = {'Matilda': 'Roald Dahl',
 *                      'Green Eggs and Ham': 'Dr Seuss',
 *                      'Where the Wild Things Are': 'Maurice Sendak'};
 *     for (var book in kidsBooks.keys) {
 *       print('$book was written by ${kidsBooks[book]}');
 *     }
 *
 * The [List] and [Set] classes are both `Iterable`,
 * as are most classes in the [dart:collection](#dart-collection) library.
 *
 * Some [Iterable] collections can be modified.
 * Adding an element to a `List` or `Set` will change which elements it
 * contains, and adding a new key to a `Map` changes the elements of [Map.keys].
 * Iterators created after the change will provide the new elements, and may
 * or may not preserve the order of existing elements
 * (for example, a [HashSet] may completely change its order when a single
 * element is added).
 *
 * Changing a collection *while* it is being iterated
 * is generally *not* allowed.
 * Doing so will break the iteration, which is typically signalled
 * by throwing a [ConcurrentModificationError]
 * the next time [Iterator.moveNext] is called.
 * The current value of [Iterator.current] getter
 * should not be affected by the change in the collection,
 * the `current` value was set by the previous call to [Iterator.moveNext].
 *
 * Some iterables compute their elements dynamically every time they are
 * iterated, like the one returned by [Iterable.generate] or the iterable
 * returned by a `sync*` generator function. If the computation doesn't depend
 * on other objects that may change, then the generated sequence should be
 * the same one every time it's iterated.
 *
 * The members of `Iterable`, other than `iterator` itself,
 * work by looking at the elements of the iterable.
 * This can be implemented by running through the [iterator], but some classes
 * may have more efficient ways of finding the result
 * (like [last] or [length] on a [List], or [contains] on a [Set]).
 *
 * The methods that return another `Iterable` (like [map] and [where])
 * are all *lazy* - they will iterate the original (as necessary)
 * every time the returned iterable is iterated, and not before.
 *
 * Since an iterable may be iterated more than once, it's not recommended to
 * have detectable side-effects in the iterator.
 * For methods like [map] and [while], the returned iterable will execute the
 * argument function on every iteration, so those functions should also not
 * have side effects.
