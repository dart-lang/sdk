/**
 * A source of asynchronous data events.
 *
 * A Stream provides a way to receive a sequence of events.
 * Each event is either a data event, also called an *element* of the stream,
 * or an error event, which is a notification that something has failed.
 * When a stream has emitted all its event,
 * a single "done" event will notify the listener that the end has been reached.
 *
 * You [listen] on a stream to make it start generating events,
 * and to set up listeners that receive the events.
 * When you listen, you receive a [StreamSubscription] object
 * which is the active object providing the events,
 * and which can be used to stop listening again,
 * or to temporarily pause events from the subscription.
 *
 * There are two kinds of streams: "Single-subscription" streams and
 * "broadcast" streams.
 *
 * *A single-subscription stream* allows only a single listener during the whole
 * lifetime of the stream.
 * It doesn't start generating events until it has a listener,
 * and it stops sending events when the listener is unsubscribed,
 * even if the source of events could still provide more.
 *
 * Listening twice on a single-subscription stream is not allowed, even after
 * the first subscription has been canceled.
 *
 * Single-subscription streams are generally used for streaming chunks of
 * larger contiguous data like file I/O.
 *
 * *A broadcast stream* allows any number of listeners, and it fires
 * its events when they are ready, whether there are listeners or not.
 *
 * Broadcast streams are used for independent events/observers.
 *
 * If several listeners want to listen to a single subscription stream,
 * use [asBroadcastStream] to create a broadcast stream on top of the
 * non-broadcast stream.
 *
 * On either kind of stream, stream transformations, such as [where] and
 * [skip], return the same type of stream as the one the method was called on,
 * unless otherwise noted.
 *
 * When an event is fired, the listener(s) at that time will receive the event.
 * If a listener is added to a broadcast stream while an event is being fired,
 * that listener will not receive the event currently being fired.
 * If a listener is canceled, it immediately stops receiving events.
 *
 * When the "done" event is fired, subscribers are unsubscribed before
 * receiving the event. After the event has been sent, the stream has no
 * subscribers. Adding new subscribers to a broadcast stream after this point
 * is allowed, but they will just receive a new "done" event as soon
 * as possible.
 *
 * Stream subscriptions always respect "pause" requests. If necessary they need
 * to buffer their input, but often, and preferably, they can simply request
 * their input to pause too.
 *
 * The default implementation of [isBroadcast] returns false.
 * A broadcast stream inheriting from [Stream] must override [isBroadcast]
 * to return `true`.

   * receives the input stream (the one passed to [bind]) and a

   * 2. by creating a new class that implements [StreamSubscription].
   *    Note that the subscription should run callbacks in the [Zone] the
