/**
 * An object representing a delayed computation.
 *
 * A [Future] is used to represent a potential value, or error,
 * that will be available at some time in the future.
 * Receivers of a [Future] can register callbacks
 * that handle the value or error once it is available.
 * For example:
 *
 *     Future<int> future = getFuture();
 *     future.then((value) => handleValue(value))
 *           .catchError((error) => handleError(error));
 *
 * A [Future] can be completed in two ways:
 * with a value ("the future succeeds")
 * or with an error ("the future fails").
 * Users can install callbacks for each case.
 *
 * In some cases we say that a future is completed with another future.
 * This is a short way of stating that the future is completed in the same way,
 * with the same value or error,
 * as the other future once that completes.
 * Whenever a function in the core library may complete a future
 * (for example [Completer.complete] or [new Future.value]),
 * then it also accepts another future and does this work for the developer.
 *
 * The result of registering a pair of callbacks is a new Future (the
 * "successor") which in turn is completed with the result of invoking the
 * corresponding callback.
 * The successor is completed with an error if the invoked callback throws.
 * For example:
 * ```
 * Future<int> successor = future.then((int value) {
 *     // Invoked when the future is completed with a value.
 *     return 42;  // The successor is completed with the value 42.
 *   },
 *   onError: (e) {
 *     // Invoked when the future is completed with an error.
 *     if (canHandle(e)) {
 *       return 499;  // The successor is completed with the value 499.
 *     } else {
 *       throw e;  // The successor is completed with the error e.
 *     }
 *   });
 * ```
 *
 * If a future does not have a successor when it completes with an error,
 * it forwards the error message to the global error-handler.
 * This behavior makes sure that no error is silently dropped.
 * However, it also means that error handlers should be installed early,
 * so that they are present as soon as a future is completed with an error.
 * The following example demonstrates this potential bug:
 * ```
 * var future = getFuture();
 * new Timer(new Duration(milliseconds: 5), () {
 *   // The error-handler is not attached until 5 ms after the future has
 *   // been received. If the future fails before that, the error is
 *   // forwarded to the global error-handler, even though there is code
 *   // (just below) to eventually handle the error.
 *   future.then((value) { useValue(value); },
 *               onError: (e) { handleError(e); });
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * When registering callbacks, it's often more readable to register the two
 * callbacks separately, by first using [then] with one argument
 * (the value handler) and using a second [catchError] for handling errors.
 * Each of these will forward the result that they don't handle
 * to their successors, and together they handle both value and error result.
 * It also has the additional benefit of the [catchError] handling errors in the
 * [then] value callback too.
 * Using sequential handlers instead of parallel ones often leads to code that
 * is easier to reason about.
 * It also makes asynchronous code very similar to synchronous code:
 * ```
 * // Synchronous code.
 * try {
 *   int value = foo();
 *   return bar(value);
 * } catch (e) {
 *   return 499;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Equivalent asynchronous code, based on futures:
 * ```
 * Future<int> future = new Future(foo);  // Result of foo() as a future.
 * future.then((int value) => bar(value))
 *       .catchError((e) => 499);
 * ```
 *
 * Similar to the synchronous code, the error handler (registered with
 * [catchError]) is handling any errors thrown by either `foo` or `bar`.
 * If the error-handler had been registered as the `onError` parameter of
 * the `then` call, it would not catch errors from the `bar` call.
 *
 * Futures can have more than one callback-pair registered. Each successor is
 * treated independently and is handled as if it was the only successor.
 *
 * A future may also fail to ever complete. In that case, no callbacks are
 * called.

 * asynchronous computation:
 * ```
 * new Future(() { doSomething(); return result; });
 * ```
 * or, if the future represents the result of a sequence of asynchronous

 * on [Future]:
 * ```
 * Future doStuff(){
 *   return someAsyncOperation().then((result) {
 *     return someOtherAsyncOperation(result);
 *   });
 * }
 * ```
 * If you do need to create a Future from scratch — for example,
 * when you're converting a callback-based API into a Future-based
 * one — you can use a Completer as follows:
 * ```
 * class AsyncOperation {
 *   Completer _completer = new Completer();
 *
 *   Future<T> doOperation() {
 *     _startOperation();
 *     return _completer.future; // Send future object back to client.
 *   }
 *
 *   // Something calls this when the value is ready.
 *   void _finishOperation(T result) {
 *     _completer.complete(result);
 *   }
 *
 *   // If something goes wrong, call this.
 *   void _errorHappened(error) {
 *     _completer.completeError(error);
 *   }

   * The completer completes the future asynchronously. That means that

   * [complete] or [completeError] is called. Instead the callbacks are

   * Completes the future synchronously.
   *
   * This constructor should be avoided unless the completion of the future is
   * known to be the final result of another asynchronous operation. If in doubt
   * use the default [Completer] constructor.
   *
   * Using an normal, asynchronous, completer will never give the wrong
   * behavior, but using a synchronous completer incorrectly can cause
   * otherwise correct programs to break.
   *
   * A synchronous completer is only intended for optimizing event
   * propagation when one asynchronous event immediately triggers another.
   * It should not be used unless the calls to [complete] and [completeError]
   * are guaranteed to occur in places where it won't break `Future` invariants.
   *
   * Completing synchronously means that the completer's future will be
   * completed immediately when calling the [complete] or [completeError]
   * method on a synchronous completer, which also calls any callbacks
   * registered on that future.
   *
   * Completing synchronously must not break the rule that when you add a
   * callback on a future, that callback must not be called until the code
   * that added the callback has completed.
   * For that reason, a synchronous completion must only occur at the very end
   * (in "tail position") of another synchronous event,
   * because at that point, completing the future immediately is be equivalent
   * to returning to the event loop and completing the future in the next
   * microtask.
   *
   * Example:
   *
   *     var completer = new Completer.sync();
   *     // The completion is the result of the asynchronous onDone event.
   *     // No other operation is performed after the completion. It is safe
   *     // to use the Completer.sync constructor.
   *     stream.listen(print, onDone: () { completer.complete("done"); });
   *
   * Bad example. Do not use this code. Only for illustrative purposes:
   *
   *     var completer = new Completer.sync();
   *     completer.future.then((_) { bar(); });
   *     // The completion is the result of the asynchronous onDone event.
   *     // However, there is still code executed after the completion. This
   *     // operation is *not* safe.
   *     stream.listen(print, onDone: () {
   *       completer.complete("done");
   *       foo();  // In this case, foo() runs after bar().
   *     });
