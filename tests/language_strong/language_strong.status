# This test does not generate the expected compile time error, but it also does
# not behave correctly at runtime. We cannot record this as "Fail" without
# confusing the DDC travis bot (as "Fail" is normally used for compile time
# failures of _negative_tests). Remove "Skip" once we have the DDC travis bot
# running on test.dart, OR when we fix dartanalyzer/dartdevc CommandOutput
# classes to invert negative test status in the same way our other tools do.
