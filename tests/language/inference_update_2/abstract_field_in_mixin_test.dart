// Tests that field promotion logic properly handles promotable abstract fields
// declared in mixins.

// In this test, there is no concrete implementation of the field in
// question. As such, it doesn't really reflect the way an abstract private
// field would be used in real-world code, but it's useful for making sure that
// an unimplemented abstract private field doesn't cause the analyzer or front
// end to misbehave. For another test in which there *is* a concrete
// implementation of the field, see
// `abstract_field_in_mixin_implemented_test.dart`.

// This test exercises both syntactic forms of creating mixin applications
// (`class C = B with M;` and `class C extends B with M {}`), since these are
// represented differently in the analyzer.

// This test exercises both the scenario in which the mixin declaration precedes
// the application, and the scenario in which it follows it. This ensures that
// the order in which the mixin declaration and application are analyzed does
// not influence the behavior.
