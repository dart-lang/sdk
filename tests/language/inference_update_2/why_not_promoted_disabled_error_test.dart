// Tests that the appropriate "why not promoted" context messages are shown when
// field promotion is disabled.
//
// The context message advising the user that field promotion is only available
// in Dart 3.2 and above is only shown if upgrading to Dart 3.2 would make field
// promotion work; otherwise, the context message explains the reason why the
// field would not be promotable even in Dart 3.2. Rationale: if a user,
// encouraged by a context message, decided to upgrade the required language
// version of their package to 3.2, only to discover that the field in question
// still wasnâ€™t promotable, that could be very frustrating.
