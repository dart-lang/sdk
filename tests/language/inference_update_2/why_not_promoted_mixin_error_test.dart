// Verifies that when a non-promotable field or getter is declared in a mixin
// and then included in a class (via a `with` clause), the appropriate "why not
// promoted" context message is generated.

// This test exercises both syntactic forms of creating mixin applications
// (`class C = B with M;` and `class C extends B with M {}`), since these are
// represented differently in the analyzer.

// This test exercises both the scenario in which the mixin declaration precedes
// the application, and the scenario in which it follows it. This ensures that
// the order in which the mixin declaration and application are analyzed does
// not influence the behavior.
