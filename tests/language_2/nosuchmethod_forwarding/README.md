# Feature tests for noSuchMethod forwarding

This directory was created in order to hold tests pertaining to the
Dart feature which causes forwarding methods to be generated
implicitly for all method signatures in the interface of a class that
declares a non-trivial `noSuchMethod`. For more details, please check
the
[feature specification](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/master/docs/language/informal/nosuchmethod-forwarding.md).
