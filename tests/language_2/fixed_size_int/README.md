# Feature tests for fixed size integers

This directory was created in order to hold tests pertaining to the Dart
feature which changes the `int` type to have a fixed-size representation
(as opposed to implicitly transitioning into an arbitrary bigint
representation when needed). For more details, please check the
[informal specification](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/master/docs/language/informal/int64.md).
