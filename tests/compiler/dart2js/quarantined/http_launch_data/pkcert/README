This is a certificate database used by Dart for testing purposes.

It is created as a certificate database by NSS (Network Security Services),
a library from Mozilla, using the certutil tool.  It uses a cert9.db file,
rather than a cert8.db file, so the database directory must be specified with
"sql:" in front of the directory path, or the environment variable
NSS_DEFAULT_DB_TYPE must be set to "sql".

The password for the key database is "dartdart".

The database contains a root certificate from Equifax, used to verify the
client https connection to www.google.dk.  It contains a self-signed
certificate for a local certificate authority myauthority_cert, and a
server certificate for localhost called localhost_cert, signed by
myauthority_cert.  It contains the key for localhost_cert, but
not the key for myauthority_cert.
