// The mock compiler of dart2js used to make the compiler crash on
// this program.
//
// The SSA backend generates a call to a throwNoSuchMethod helper for
// the access to `foo`, and we used to not infer return types of
// helpers, so we did not know throwNoSuchMethod was not returning.
// As a consequence, all operator[] had to be compiled, and due to
// missing backend dependencies, some of them were not resolved.
