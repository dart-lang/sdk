package/invalid_uri_test: Fail, OK # Fails intentionally

[ $runtime == vm ]
# Fails because checked-in dart executable is not up to date.
io/test_runner_test: Fail
# Fails because checked-in dart executable is not up to date.
# Skip this because it is leaving temp directories behind when it fails.
io/skipping_dart2js_compilations_test: Skip

[ $runtime == vm ]
package/package_isolate_test: Fail # http://dartbug.com/7520.
# The test is flaky, and is timing out, causing buildbot cycle times to rise.
io/raw_server_socket_cancel_test: Skip # Issue 8675

io/stdout_bad_argument_test: Fail, OK
# These test have type errors on purpose and take very long to run in
# checked mode with no benefit. Skip.

[ $runtime == vm && $system == macos ]
# This test fails with "Too many open files" on the Mac OS buildbot.
# This is expected as MacOS by default runs with a very low number
# of allowed open files ('ulimit -n' says something like 256).
io/socket_many_connections_test: Skip

# These tests pass on MacOS 10.8.2 but fails on the buildbot machines
# that are running an earlier version of MacOS. The issue is that the
# old version of MacOS does not expand the precomposed utf-8 it gets
# from the VM before comparing it to the decomposed utf-8 used for the
# file system.
