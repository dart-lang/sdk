Run Existing Tests
==================

See the output of

  ../tools/test.py --help

for how to run tests.

See also

  https://code.google.com/p/dart/wiki/Building#Testing

for detailed examples.

Create New Tests
================

See comments above

  factory StandardTestSuite.forDirectory

in

  ../tools/testing/dart/test_suite.dart

for the default test directory layout. By default test-file names must
end in "_test.dart", but some test suites, such as ./co19, subclass
StandardTestSuite and override this default.

See comments at the beginning of

  ../tools/testing/dart/multitest.dart

for how to create tests that pass by failing with a known error. For
example,

  ...
  int x = "not an int"; /// 01: static type warning
  ...

as part of a test will only pass the "--compiler dartanalyzer" test if
the assignment generates a static type warning.
