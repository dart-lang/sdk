# Dart VM Service Protocol 3.5

> Please post feedback to the [observatory-discuss group][discuss-list]

This document describes of _version 3.5_ of the Dart VM Service Protocol. This
protocol is used to communicate with a running Dart Virtual Machine.

To use the Service Protocol, start the VM with the *--observe* flag.
The VM will start a webserver which services protocol requests via WebSocket.
It is possible to make HTTP (non-WebSocket) requests,
but this does not allow access to VM _events_ and is not documented
here.

The Service Protocol uses [JSON-RPC 2.0][].

## RPCs, Requests, and Responses

An RPC request is a JSON object sent to the server. Here is an
example [getVersion](#getversion) request:

```
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "getVersion",
  "params": {},
  "id": "1"
}
```

The _id_ property must be a string, number, or `null`. The Service Protocol
optionally accepts requests without the _jsonprc_ property.

An RPC response is a JSON object (http://json.org/). The response always specifies an
_id_ property to pair it with the corresponding request. If the RPC
was successful, the _result_ property provides the result.

Here is an example response for our [getVersion](#getversion) request above:

```
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "type": "Version",
    "major": 3,
    "minor": 5
  }
  "id": "1"
}
```

Parameters for RPC requests are always provided as _named_ parameters.
The JSON-RPC spec provides for _positional_ parameters as well, but they
are not supported by the Dart VM.

By convention, every response returned by the Service Protocol is a subtype
of [Response](#response) and provides a _type_ parameter which can be used
to distinguish the exact return type. In the example above, the
[Version](#version) type is returned.

Here is an example [streamListen](#streamlisten) request which provides
a parameter:

```
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "streamListen",
  "params": {
    "streamId": "GC",
  },
  "id": "2"
}
```

<a name="rpc-error"></a>
When an RPC encounters an error, it is provided in the _error_
property of the response object. JSON-RPC errors always provide
_code_, _message_, and _data_ properties.

Here is an example error response for our [streamListen](#streamlisten)
request above. This error would be generated if we were attempting to
subscribe to the _GC_ stream multiple times from the same client.

```
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "error": {
    "code": 103,
    "message": "Stream already subscribed",
    "data": {
      "details": "The stream 'GC' is already subscribed"
    }
  }
  "id": "2"
}
```

In addition to the [error codes](http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#error_object) specified in the JSON-RPC spec, we use the following application specific error codes:

code | message | meaning
---- | ------- | -------
100 | Feature is disabled | The operation is unable to complete because a feature is disabled
101 | VM must be paused | This operation is only valid when the VM is paused
102 | Cannot add breakpoint | The VM is unable to add a breakpoint at the specified line or function
103 | Stream already subscribed | The client is already subscribed to the specified _streamId_
104 | Stream not subscribed | The client is not subscribed to the specified _streamId_
105 | Isolate must be runnable | This operation cannot happen until the isolate is runnable
106 | Isolate must be paused | This operation is only valid when the isolate is paused




## Events

By using the [streamListen](#streamlisten) and [streamCancel](#streamcancel) RPCs, a client may
request to be notified when an _event_ is posted to a specific
_stream_ in the VM. Every stream has an associated _stream id_ which
is used to name that stream.

Each stream provides access to certain kinds of events. For example the _Isolate_ stream provides
access to events pertaining to isolate births, deaths, and name changes. See [streamListen](#streamlisten)
for a list of the well-known stream ids and their associated events.

Stream events arrive asynchronously over the WebSocket. They're structured as
JSON-RPC 2.0 requests with no _id_ property. The _method_ property will be
_streamNotify_, and the _params_ will have _streamId_ and _event_ properties:

```json
{
  "json-rpc": "2.0",
  "method": "streamNotify",
  "params": {
    "streamId": "Isolate",
    "event": {
      "type": "Event",
      "kind": "IsolateExit",
      "isolate": {
        "type": "@Isolate",
        "id": "isolates/33",
        "number": "51048743613",
        "name": "worker-isolate"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

It is considered a _backwards compatible_ change to add a new type of event to an existing stream.
Clients should be written to handle this gracefully.



## Types

By convention, every result and event provided by the Service Protocol
is a subtype of [Response](#response) and has the _type_ property.
This allows the client to distinguish different kinds of responses. For example,
information about a Dart function is returned using the [Function](#function) type.

If the type of a response begins with the _@_ character, then that
response is a _reference_. If the type name of a response does not
begin with the _@_ character, it is the an _object_. A reference is
intended to be a subset of an object which provides enough information
to generate a reasonable looking reference to the object.

For example, an [@Isolate](#isolate) reference has the _type_, _id_, _name_ and
_number_ properties:

```
  "result": {
    "type": "@Isolate",
    "id": "isolates/33",
    "number": "51048743613"
    "name": "worker-isolate"
  }
```

But an [Isolate](#isolate) object has more information:

```
  "result": {
    "type": "Isolate",
    "id": "isolates/33",
    "number": "51048743613"
    "name": "worker-isolate"
    "rootLib": { ... }
    "entry": ...
    "heaps": ...
     ...
  }
```

## IDs and Names

Many responses returned by the Service Protocol have an _id_ property.
This is an identifier used to request an object from an isolate using
the [getObject](#getobject) RPC. If two responses have the same _id_ then they
refer to the same object. The converse is not true: the same object
may sometimes be returned with two different values for _id_.

The _id_ property should be treated as an opaque string by the client:
it is not meant to be parsed.

An id can be either _temporary_ or _fixed_:

* A _temporary_ id can expire over time. The VM allocates certain ids
  in a ring which evicts old ids over time.

* A _fixed_ id will never expire, but the object it refers to may
  be collected. The VM uses fixed ids for objects like scripts,
  libraries, and classes.

If an id is fixed, the _fixedId_ property will be true. If an id is temporary
the _fixedId_ property will be omitted.

Sometimes a temporary id may expire. In this case, some RPCs may return
an _Expired_ [Sentinel](#sentinel) to indicate this.

The object referred to by an id may be collected by the VM's garbage
collector. In this case, some RPCs may return a _Collected_ [Sentinel](#sentinel)
to indicate this.

Many objects also have a _name_ property. This is provided so that
objects can be displayed in a way that a Dart language programmer
would find familiar. Names are not unique.

## Versioning

The [getVersion](#getversion) RPC can be used to find the version of the protocol
returned by a VM. The _Version_ response has a major and a minor
version number:

```
  "result": {
    "type": "Version",
    "major": 3,
    "minor": 5
  }
```

The major version number is incremented when the protocol is changed
in a potentially _incompatible_ way. An example of an incompatible
change is removing a non-optional property from a result.

The minor version number is incremented when the protocol is changed
in a _backwards compatible_ way. An example of a backwards compatible
change is adding a property to a result.

Certain changes that would normally not be backwards compatible are
considered backwards compatible for the purposes of versioning.
Specifically, additions can be made to the [EventKind](#eventkind) and
[InstanceKind](#instancekind) enumerated types and the client must
handle this gracefully. See the notes on these enumerated types for more
information.

## Private RPCs, Types, and Properties

Any RPC, type, or property which begins with an underscore is said to
be _private_. These RPCs, types, and fields can be changed at any
time without changing major or minor version numbers.

The intention is that the Service Protocol will evolve by adding
private RPCs which may, over time, migrate to the public api as they
become stable. Some private types and properties expose VM specific
implementation state and will never be appropriate to add to
the public api.

## Public RPCs

The following is a list of all public RPCs supported by the Service Protocol.

An RPC is described using the following format:

```
ReturnType methodName(parameterType1 parameterName1,
                      parameterType2, parameterName2,
                      ...)
```

If an RPC says it returns type _T_ it may actually return _T_ or any
[subtype](#public-types) of _T_. For example, an
RPC which is declared to return [@Object](#object) may actually
return [@Instance](#instance).

If an RPC can return one or more independent types, this is indicated
with the vertical bar:

```
ReturnType1|ReturnType2
```

Any RPC may return an _error_ response as [described above](#rpc-error).

Some parameters are optional. This is indicated by the text
_[optional]_ following the parameter name:

```
ReturnType methodName(parameterType parameterName [optional)
```

A description of the return types and parameter types is provided
in the section on [public types](#public-types).

### addBreakpoint

```
Breakpoint addBreakpoint(string isolateId,
                         string scriptId,
                         int line,
                         int column [optional])
```

The _addBreakpoint_ RPC is used to add a breakpoint at a specific line
of some script.

The _scriptId_ parameter is used to specify the target script.

The _line_ parameter is used to specify the target line for the
breakpoint. If there are multiple possible breakpoints on the target
line, then the VM will place the breakpoint at the location which
would execute soonest. If it is not possible to set a breakpoint at
the target line, the breakpoint will be added at the next possible
breakpoint location within the same function.

The _column_ parameter may be optionally specified.  This is useful
for targeting a specific breakpoint on a line with multiple possible
breakpoints.

If no breakpoint is possible at that line, the _102_ (Cannot add
breakpoint) error code is returned.

Note that breakpoints are added and removed on a per-isolate basis.

See [Breakpoint](#breakpoint).

### addBreakpointWithScriptUri

```
Breakpoint addBreakpointWithScriptUri(string isolateId,
                                      string scriptUri,
                                      int line,
                                      int column [optional])
```

The _addBreakpoint_ RPC is used to add a breakpoint at a specific line
of some script.  This RPC is useful when a script has not yet been
assigned an id, for example, if a script is in a deferred library
which has not yet been loaded.

The _scriptUri_ parameter is used to specify the target script.

The _line_ parameter is used to specify the target line for the
breakpoint. If there are multiple possible breakpoints on the target
line, then the VM will place the breakpoint at the location which
would execute soonest. If it is not possible to set a breakpoint at
the target line, the breakpoint will be added at the next possible
breakpoint location within the same function.

The _column_ parameter may be optionally specified.  This is useful
for targeting a specific breakpoint on a line with multiple possible
breakpoints.

If no breakpoint is possible at that line, the _102_ (Cannot add
breakpoint) error code is returned.

Note that breakpoints are added and removed on a per-isolate basis.

See [Breakpoint](#breakpoint).

### addBreakpointAtEntry

```
Breakpoint addBreakpointAtEntry(string isolateId,
                                string functionId)
```
The _addBreakpointAtEntry_ RPC is used to add a breakpoint at the
entrypoint of some function.

If no breakpoint is possible at the function entry, the _102_ (Cannot add
breakpoint) error code is returned.

See [Breakpoint](#breakpoint).

Note that breakpoints are added and removed on a per-isolate basis.

### evaluate

```
@Instance|@Error|Sentinel evaluate(string isolateId,
                                   string targetId,
                                   string expression)
```

The _evaluate_ RPC is used to evaluate an expression in the context of
some target.

_targetId_ may refer to a [Library](#library), [Class](#class), or
[Instance](#instance).

If _targetId_ is a temporary id which has expired, then the _Expired_
[Sentinel](#sentinel) is returned.

If _targetId_ refers to an object which has been collected by the VM's
garbage collector, then the _Collected_ [Sentinel](#sentinel) is
returned.

If an error occurs while evaluating the expression, an [@Error](#error)
reference will be returned.

If the expression is evaluated successfully, an [@Instance](#instance)
reference will be returned.

### evaluateInFrame

```
@Instance|@Error evaluateInFrame(string isolateId,
                                 int frameIndex,
                                 string expression)
```

The _evaluateInFrame_ RPC is used to evaluate an expression in the
context of a particular stack frame. _frameIndex_ is the index of the
desired [Frame](#frame), with an index of _0_ indicating the top (most
recent) frame.

If an error occurs while evaluating the expression, an [@Error](#error)
reference will be returned.

If the expression is evaluated successfully, an [@Instance](#instance)
reference will be returned.

### getFlagList

```
FlagList getFlagList()
```

The _getFlagList_ RPC returns a list of all command line flags in the
VM along with their current values.

See [FlagList](#flaglist).

### getIsolate

```
Isolate|Sentinel getIsolate(string isolateId)
```

The _getIsolate_ RPC is used to lookup an _Isolate_ object by its _id_.

If _isolateId_ refers to an isolate which has exited, then the
_Collected_ [Sentinel](#sentinel) is returned.

See [Isolate](#isolate).

### getObject

```
Object|Sentinel getObject(string isolateId,
                          string objectId,
                          int offset [optional],
                          int count [optional])
```

The _getObject_ RPC is used to lookup an _object_ from some isolate by
its _id_.

If _objectId_ is a temporary id which has expired, then the _Expired_
[Sentinel](#sentinel) is returned.

If _objectId_ refers to a heap object which has been collected by the VM's
garbage collector, then the _Collected_ [Sentinel](#sentinel) is
returned.

If _objectId_ refers to a non-heap object which has been deleted, then
the _Collected_ [Sentinel](#sentinel) is returned.

If the object handle has not expired and the object has not been
collected, then an [Object](#object) will be returned.

The _offset_ and _count_ parameters are used to request subranges of
Instance objects with the kinds: String, List, Map, Uint8ClampedList,
Uint8List, Uint16List, Uint32List, Uint64List, Int8List, Int16List,
Int32List, Int64List, Flooat32List, Float64List, Inst32x3List,
Float32x4List, and Float64x2List.  These parameters are otherwise
ignored.

### getStack

```
Stack getStack(string isolateId)
```

The _getStack_ RPC is used to retrieve the current execution stack and
message queue for an isolate. The isolate does not need to be paused.

See [Stack](#stack).

### getSourceReport

```
SourceReport getSourceReport(string isolateId,
                             SourceReportKind[] reports,
                             string scriptId [optional],
                             int tokenPos [optional],
                             int endTokenPos [optional],
                             bool forceCompile [optional])
```

The _getSourceReport_ RPC is used to generate a set of reports tied to
source locations in an isolate.

The _reports_ parameter is used to specify which reports should be
generated.  The _reports_ parameter is a list, which allows multiple
reports to be generated simultaneously from a consistent isolate
state.  The _reports_ parameter is allowed to be empty (this might be
used to force compilation of a particular subrange of some script).

The available report kinds are:

report kind | meaning
----------- | -------
Coverage | Provide code coverage information
PossibleBreakpoints | Provide a list of token positions which correspond to possible breakpoints.

The _scriptId_ parameter is used to restrict the report to a
particular script.  When analyzing a particular script, either or both
of the _tokenPos_ and _endTokenPos_ parameters may be provided to
restrict the analysis to a subrange of a script (for example, these
can be used to restrict the report to the range of a particular class
or function).

If the _scriptId_ parameter is not provided then the reports are
generated for all loaded scripts and the _tokenPos_ and _endTokenPos_
parameters are disallowed.

The _forceCompilation_ parameter can be used to force compilation of
all functions in the range of the report.  Forcing compilation can
cause a compilation error, which could terminate the running Dart
program.  If this parameter is not provided, it is considered to have
the value _false_.

See [SourceReport](#sourcereport).

### getVersion

```
Version getVersion()
```

The _getVersion_ RPC is used to determine what version of the Service Protocol is served by a VM.

See [Version](#version).

### getVM

```
VM getVM()
```

The _getVM_ RPC returns global information about a Dart virtual machine.

See [VM](#vm).

### pause

```
Success pause(string isolateId)
```

The _pause_ RPC is used to interrupt a running isolate. The RPC enqueues the interrupt request and potentially returns before the isolate is paused.

When the isolate is paused an event will be sent on the _Debug_ stream.

See [Success](#success).

### removeBreakpoint

```
Success removeBreakpoint(string isolateId,
                         string breakpointId)
```

The _removeBreakpoint_ RPC is used to remove a breakpoint by its _id_.

Note that breakpoints are added and removed on a per-isolate basis.

See [Success](#success).

### resume

```
Success resume(string isolateId,
               StepOption step [optional])
```

The _resume_ RPC is used to resume execution of a paused isolate.

If the _step_ parameter is not provided, the program will resume
regular execution.

If the _step_ parameter is provided, it indicates what form of
single-stepping to use.

step | meaning
---- | -------
Into | Single step, entering function calls
Over | Single step, skipping over function calls
Out | Single step until the current function exits

See [Success](#success), [StepOption](#StepOption).

### setExceptionPauseMode

```
Success setExceptionPauseMode(string isolateId,
                              ExceptionPauseMode mode)
```

The _setExceptionPauseMode_ RPC is used to control if an isolate pauses when
an exception is thrown.

mode | meaning
---- | -------
None | Do not pause isolate on thrown exceptions
Unhandled | Pause isolate on unhandled exceptions
All  | Pause isolate on all thrown exceptions


### setLibraryDebuggable

```
Success setLibraryDebuggable(string isolateId,
                             string libraryId,
                             bool isDebuggable)
```

The _setLibraryDebuggable_ RPC is used to enable or disable whether
breakpoints and stepping work for a given library.

See [Success](#success).

### setName

```
Success setName(string isolateId,
                string name)
```

The _setName_ RPC is used to change the debugging name for an isolate.

See [Success](#success).

### setVMName

```
Success setVMName(string name)
```

The _setVMName_ RPC is used to change the debugging name for the vm.

See [Success](#success).

### streamCancel

```
Success streamCancel(string streamId)
```

The _streamCancel_ RPC cancels a stream subscription in the VM.

If the client is not subscribed to the stream, the _104_ (Stream not
subscribed) error code is returned.

See [Success](#success).

### streamListen

```
Success streamListen(string streamId)
```

The _streamListen_ RPC subscribes to a stream in the VM. Once
subscribed, the client will begin receiving events from the stream.

If the client is not subscribed to the stream, the _103_ (Stream already
subscribed) error code is returned.

The _streamId_ parameter may have the following published values:

streamId | event types provided
-------- | -----------
VM | VMUpdate
Isolate | IsolateStart, IsolateRunnable, IsolateExit, IsolateUpdate, ServiceExtensionAdded
Debug | PauseStart, PauseExit, PauseBreakpoint, PauseInterrupted, PauseException, Resume, BreakpointAdded, BreakpointResolved, BreakpointRemoved, Inspect, None
GC | GC
Extension | Extension
Timeline | TimelineEvents

Additionally, some embedders provide the _Stdout_ and _Stderr_
streams.  These streams allow the client to subscribe to writes to
stdout and stderr.

streamId | event types provided
-------- | -----------
Stdout | WriteEvent
Stderr | WriteEvent

It is considered a _backwards compatible_ change to add a new type of event to an existing stream.
Clients should be written to handle this gracefully, perhaps by warning and ignoring.

See [Success](#success).

## Public Types

The following is a list of all public types produced by the Service Protocol.

We define a small set of primitive types, based on JSON equivalents.

type | meaning
---- | -------
string | JSON string values
bool | JSON _true_, _false_
int | JSON numbers without fractions or exponents
float | any JSON number

Note that the Service Protocol does not use JSON _null_.

We describe the format of our JSON objects with the following class format:

```
class T {
  string name;
  int count;
  ...
}
```

This describes a JSON object type _T_ with some set of expected properties.

Types are organized into an inheritance hierarchy. If type _T_
extends type _S_...

```
class S {
  string a;
}

class T extends S {
  string b;
}
```

...then that means that all properties of _S_ are also present in type
_T_. In the example above, type _T_ would have the expected
properties _a_ and _b_.

If a property has an _Array_ type, it is written with brackets:

```
  PropertyType[] arrayProperty;
```

If a property is optional, it is suffixed with the text _[optional]_:

```
  PropertyType optionalProperty [optional];
```

If a property can have multiple independent types, we denote this with
a vertical bar:

```
  PropertyType1|PropertyType2 complexProperty;
```

We also allow parenthesis on type expressions.  This is useful when a property
is an _Array_ of multiple independent types:

```
  (PropertyType1|PropertyType2)[]
```

When a string is only permitted to take one of a certain set of values,
we indicate this by the use of the _enum_ format:

```
enum PermittedValues {
  Value1,
  Value2
}
```

This means that _PermittedValues_ is a _string_ with two potential values,
_Value1_ and _Value2_.

### BoundField

```
class BoundField {
  @Field decl;
  @Instance|Sentinel value;
}
```

A _BoundField_ represents a field bound to a particular value in an
_Instance_.

If the field is uninitialized, the _value_ will be the
_NotInitialized_ [Sentinel](#sentinel).

If the field is being initialized, the _value_ will be the
_BeingInitialized_ [Sentinel](#sentinel).

### BoundVariable

```
class BoundVariable {
  string name;
  @Instance|Sentinel value;

  // The token position where this variable was declared.
  int declarationTokenPos;

  // The first token position where this variable is visible to the scope.

A _BoundVariable_ represents a local variable bound to a particular value
in a _Frame_.

If the variable is uninitialized, the _value_ will be the
_NotInitialized_ [Sentinel](#sentinel).

If the variable is being initialized, the _value_ will be the
_BeingInitialized_ [Sentinel](#sentinel).

If the variable has been optimized out by the compiler, the _value_
will be the _OptimizedOut_ [Sentinel](#sentinel).

### Breakpoint

```
class Breakpoint extends Object {
  // A number identifying this breakpoint to the user.
  int breakpointNumber;

  // Has this breakpoint been assigned to a specific program location?
  bool resolved;

  // Is this a breakpoint that was added synthetically as part of a step
  // OverAsyncSuspension resume command?
  bool isSyntheticAsyncContinuation [optional];

  // SourceLocation when breakpoint is resolved, UnresolvedSourceLocation
  // when a breakpoint is not resolved.
  SourceLocation|UnresolvedSourceLocation location;
}
```

A _Breakpoint_ describes a debugger breakpoint.

A breakpoint is _resolved_ when it has been assigned to a specific
program location.  A breakpoint my remain unresolved when it is in
code which has not yet been compiled or in a library which has not
been loaded (i.e. a deferred library).

  SourceLocation location [optional];
}
```

A _Message_ provides information about a pending isolate message and the
function that will be invoked to handle it.


### Null

```
class @Null extends @Instance {
  // Always 'null'.
  string valueAsString;
}
```

_@Null_ is a reference to an a _Null_.

```
class Null extends Instance {
  // Always 'null'.
  string valueAsString;
}
```

A _Null_ object represents the Dart language value null.

### Object

```
class @Object extends Response {
  // A unique identifier for an Object. Passed to the
  // getObject RPC to load this Object.
  string id;
}
```

_@Object_ is a reference to a _Object_.

```
class Object extends Response {
  // A unique identifier for an Object. Passed to the
  // getObject RPC to reload this Object.
  //
  // Some objects may get a new id when they are reloaded.
  string id;

  // If an object is allocated in the Dart heap, it will have
  // a corresponding class object.
  //
  // The class of a non-instance is not a Dart class, but is instead
  // an internal vm object.
  //
  // Moving an Object into or out of the heap is considered a
  // backwards compatible change for types other than Instance.
  @Class class [optional];

  // The size of this object in the heap.
  //
  // If an object is not heap-allocated, then this field is omitted.
  //
  // Note that the size can be zero for some objects. In the current
  // VM implementation, this occurs for small integers, which are
  // stored entirely within their object pointers.
  int size [optional];
}
```

An _Object_ is a  persistent object that is owned by some isolate.

### Response

```
class Response {
  // Every response returned by the VM Service has the
  // type property. This allows the client distinguish
  // between different kinds of responses.
  string type;
}
```

Every non-error response returned by the Service Protocol extends _Response_.
By using the _type_ property, the client can determine which [type](#types)
of response has been provided.

### Sentinel

```
class Sentinel extends Response {
  // What kind of sentinel is this?
  SentinelKind kind;

  // A reasonable string representation of this sentinel.
  string valueAsString;
}
```

A _Sentinel_ is used to indicate that the normal response is not available.

We use a _Sentinel_ instead of an [error](#errors) for these cases because
they do not represent a problematic condition. They are normal.

### SentinelKind

```
enum SentinelKind {
  // Indicates that the object referred to has been collected by the GC.
  Collected,

  // Indicates that an object id has expired.
  Expired,

  // Indicates that a variable or field has not been initialized.
  NotInitialized,

  // Indicates that a variable or field is in the process of being initialized.
  BeingInitialized,

  // Indicates that a variable has been eliminated by the optimizing compiler.
  OptimizedOut,

  // Reserved for future use.
  Free,
}
```

A _SentinelKind_ is used to distinguish different kinds of _Sentinel_ objects.

Adding new values to _SentinelKind_ is considered a backwards
compatible change. Clients must handle this gracefully.

### Script

```
class @Script extends @Object {
  // The uri from which this script was loaded.
  string uri;
}
```

_@Script_ is a reference to a _Script_.

```
class Script extends Object {
  // The uri from which this script was loaded.
  string uri;

  // The library which owns this script.
  @Library library;

  // The source code for this script. For certain built-in scripts,
  // this may be reconstructed without source comments.
  string source;

  // A table encoding a mapping from token position to line and column.
  int[][] tokenPosTable;
}
```

A _Script_ provides information about a Dart language script.

The _tokenPosTable_ is an array of int arrays. Each subarray
consists of a line number followed by _(tokenPos, columnNumber)_ pairs:

> [lineNumber, (tokenPos, columnNumber)*]

The _tokenPos_ is an arbitrary integer value that is used to represent
a location in the source code.  A _tokenPos_ value is not meaningful
in itself and code should not rely on the exact values returned.

For example, a _tokenPosTable_ with the value...

> [[1, 100, 5, 101, 8],[2, 102, 7]]

...encodes the mapping:

tokenPos | line | column
-------- | ---- | ------
100 | 1 | 5
101 | 1 | 8
102 | 2 | 7

### SourceLocation

```
class SourceLocation extends Response {
  // The script containing the source location.
  @Script script;

  // The first token of the location.
  int tokenPos;

  // The last token of the location if this is a range.
  int endTokenPos [optional];
}
```

The _SourceLocation_ class is used to designate a position or range in
some script.

### SourceReport

```
class SourceReport extends Response {
  // A list of ranges in the program source.  These ranges correspond
  // to ranges of executable code in the user's program (functions,
  // methods, constructors, etc.)
  //
  // Note that ranges may nest in other ranges, in the case of nested
  // functions.
  //
  // Note that ranges may be duplicated, in the case of mixins.
  SourceReportRange[] ranges;

  // A list of scripts, referenced by index in the report's ranges.
  ScriptRef[] scripts;
}
```

The _SourceReport_ class represents a set of reports tied to source
locations in an isolate.

### SourceReportCoverage

```
class SourceReportCoverage {
  // A list of token positions in a SourceReportRange which have been
  // executed.  The list is sorted.
  int[] hits;

  // A list of token positions in a SourceReportRange which have not been
  // executed.  The list is sorted.
  int[] misses;
}
```

The _SourceReportCoverage_ class represents coverage information for
one [SourceReportRange](#sourcereportrange).

Note that _SourceReportCoverage_ does not extend [Response](#response)
and therefore will not contain a _type_ property.

### SourceReportKind

```
enum SourceReportKind {
  // Used to request a code coverage information.
  Coverage,

  // Used to request a list of token positions of possible breakpoints.
  PossibleBreakpoints
}
```

### SourceReportRange

```
class SourceReportRange {
  // An index into the script table of the SourceReport, indicating
  // which script contains this range of code.
  int scriptIndex;

  // The token position at which this range begins.
  int startPos;

  // The token position at which this range ends.  Inclusive.
  int endPos;

  // Has this range been compiled by the Dart VM?
  bool compiled;

  // The error while attempting to compile this range, if this
  // report was generated with forceCompile=true.
  @Error error [optional];

  // Code coverage information for this range.  Provided only when the
  // Coverage report has been requested and the range has been
  // compiled.
  SourceReportCoverage coverage [optional];

  // Possible breakpoint information for this range, represented as a
  // sorted list of token positions.  Provided only when the when the
  // PossibleBreakpoint report has been requested and the range has been
  // compiled.
  int[] possibleBreakpoints [optional];
}
```

The _SourceReportRange_ class represents a range of executable code
(function, method, constructor, etc) in the running program.  It is
part of a [SourceReport](#sourcereport).

Note that _SourceReportRange_ does not extend [Response](#response)
and therefore will not contain a _type_ property.

### Stack

```
class Stack extends Response {
  Frame[] frames;
  Message[] messages;
}
```

### ExceptionPauseMode

```
enum ExceptionPauseMode {
  None,
  Unhandled,
  All,
}
```

An _ExceptionPauseMode_ indicates how the isolate pauses when an exception
is thrown.

### StepOption

```
enum StepOption {
  Into,
  Over,
  OverAsyncSuspension,
  Out
}
```

A _StepOption_ indicates which form of stepping is requested in a [resume](#resume) RPC.

### Success

```
class Success extends Response {
}
```

The _Success_ type is used to indicate that an operation completed successfully.

### TimelineEvent

```
class TimelineEvent {
}
```

An _TimelineEvent_ is an arbitrary map that contains a [Trace Event Format](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CvAClvFfyA5R-PhYUmn5OOQtYMH4h6I0nSsKchNAySU/preview) event.

### TypeArguments

```
class @TypeArguments extends @Object {
  // A name for this type argument list.
  string name;
}
```

_@TypeArguments_ is a reference to a _TypeArguments_ object.

```
class TypeArguments extends Object {
  // A name for this type argument list.
  string name;

  // A list of types.
  //
  // The value will always be one of the kinds:
  // Type, TypeRef, TypeParameter, BoundedType.
  @Instance[] types;
}
```

A _TypeArguments_ object represents the type argument vector for some
instantiated generic type.

### UnresolvedSourceLocation

```
class UnresolvedSourceLocation extends Response {
  // The script containing the source location if the script has been loaded.
  @Script script [optional];

  // The uri of the script containing the source location if the script
  // has yet to be loaded.
  string scriptUri [optional];

  // An approximate token position for the source location. This may
  // change when the location is resolved.
  int tokenPos [optional];

  // An approximate line number for the source location. This may
  // change when the location is resolved.
  int line [optional];

  // An approximate column number for the source location. This may
  // change when the location is resolved.
  int column [optional];

}
```

The _UnresolvedSourceLocation_ class is used to refer to an unresolved
breakpoint location.  As such, it is meant to approximate the final
location of the breakpoint but it is not exact.

Either the _script_ or the _scriptUri_ field will be present.

Either the _tokenPos_ or the _line_ field will be present.

The _column_ field will only be present when the breakpoint was
specified with a specific column number.

### Version

```
class Version extends Response {
  // The major version number is incremented when the protocol is changed
  // in a potentially incompatible way.
  int major;

  // The minor version number is incremented when the protocol is changed
  // in a backwards compatible way.
  int minor;
}
```

See [Versioning](#versioning).

### VM

```
class @VM extends Response {
  // A name identifying this vm. Not guaranteed to be unique.
  string name;
}
```

_@VM_ is a reference to a _VM_ object.

```
class VM extends Response {
  // Word length on target architecture (e.g. 32, 64).
  int architectureBits;

  // The CPU we are generating code for.
  string targetCPU;

  // The CPU we are actually running on.
  string hostCPU;

  // The Dart VM version string.
  string version;

  // The process id for the VM.
  int pid;

  // The time that the VM started in milliseconds since the epoch.
  //
  // Suitable to pass to DateTime.fromMillisecondsSinceEpoch.
  int startTime;

  // A list of isolates running in the VM.
  @Isolate[] isolates;
}
```

1.0 | initial revision
2.0 | Describe protocol version 2.0.
3.0 | Describe protocol version 3.0.  Added UnresolvedSourceLocation.  Added Sentinel return to getIsolate.  Add AddedBreakpointWithScriptUri.  Removed Isolate.entry. The type of VM.pid was changed from string to int.  Added VMUpdate events.  Add offset and count parameters to getObject() and offset and count fields to Instance. Added ServiceExtensionAdded event.
3.1 | Add the getSourceReport RPC.  The getObject RPC now accepts offset and count for string objects.  String objects now contain length, offset, and count properties.
3.2 | Isolate objects now include the runnable bit and many debugger related RPCs will return an error if executed on an isolate before it is runnable.
3.3 | Pause event now indicates if the isolate is paused at an await, yield, or yield* suspension point via the 'atAsyncSuspension' field. Resume command now supports the step parameter 'OverAsyncSuspension'. A Breakpoint added synthetically by an 'OverAsyncSuspension' resume command identifies itself as such via the 'isSyntheticAsyncContinuation' field.
3.4 | Add the superType and mixin fields to Class. Added new pause event 'None'.
3.5 | Add the error field to SourceReportRange.  Clarify definition of token position.  Add "Isolate must be paused" error code.
3.6 (unreleased) | Add 'scopeStartTokenPos', 'scopeEndTokenPos', and 'declarationTokenPos' to BoundVariable.
