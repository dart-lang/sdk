# Dart VM Service Protocol Extension 1.6

This protocol describes service extensions that are made available through
the Dart core libraries, but are not part of the core
[Dart VM Service Protocol](service.md). Service extension methods are
invoked by prepending the service extension name (e.g.,
"ext.dart.libraryName") to the RPC to be invoked. For example, the
`getSocketProfile` RPC exposed through dart:io can be executed by invoking
`ext.dart.io.getSocketProfile`.

## dart:io Extensions

This section describes _version 1.6_ of the dart:io service protocol extensions.

### getVersion

```
Version getVersion(string isolateId)
```

The _getVersion_ RPC returns the available version of the dart:io service protocol extensions.

See [Version](#version).

### socketProfilingEnabled

```
SocketProfilingState socketProfilingEnabled(string isolateId, bool enabled [optional])
```

The _socketProfilingEnabled_ RPC is used to enable/disable the socket profiler
and query its current state. If `enabled` is provided, the profiler state will
be updated to reflect the value of `enabled`.

If the state of the socket profiler is changed, a `SocketProfilingStateChange`
event will be sent on the `Extension` stream.

See [SocketProfilingState](#socketprofilingstate).

### startSocketProfiling

```
@Deprecated
Success startSocketProfiling(string isolateId)
```

Start profiling new socket connections. Statistics for sockets created before profiling was enabled will not be recorded.

See [Success](#success).

### pauseSocketProfiling

```
@Deprecated
Success pauseSocketProfiling(string isolateId)
```

Pause recording socket statistics. [clearSocketProfile](#clearsocketprofile) must be called in order for collected statistics to be cleared.

See [Success](#success).

### clearSocketProfile

```
Success clearSocketProfile(string isolateId)
```

Removes all statistics associated with prior and current sockets.

See [Success](#success).

### getOpenFileById

```
OpenFile getOpenFileById(string isolateId, int id);
```

The _getOpenFileById_ RPC is used to retrieve information about files currently
opened by `dart:io` from a given isolate.

See [getOpenFiles](#getopenfiles) and [File](#file).

### getOpenFiles

```
FileList getOpenFiles(string isolateId);
```

The _getOpenFiles_ RPC is used to retrieve the list of files currently opened
files by `dart:io` from a given isolate.

See [FileList](#filelist) and [File](#file).

### getSpawnedProcessById

```
SpawnedProcess getSpawnedProcessById(string isolateId, int id);
```

The _getSpawnedProcessById_ RPC is used to retrieve information about a process spawned
by `dart:io` from a given isolate.

See [getSpawnedProcesses](#getspawnedprocesses) and [SpawnedProcess](#spawnedprocess).

### getSpawnedProcesses

```
SpawnedProcessList getSpawnedProcesses(string isolateId);
```

The _getSpawnedProcesses_ RPC is used to retrieve the list of processed opened by
`dart:io` from a given isolate.

See [SpawnedProcessList](#spawnedprocesslist) and [SpawnedProcess](#spawnedprocess).

### getSocketProfile

```
SocketProfile getSocketProfile(string isolateId)
```

The _getSocketProfile_ RPC is used to retrieve socket statistics collected by
the socket profiler. Only samples collected after the initial [startSocketProfiling](#startsocketprofiling) or the last call to [clearSocketProfile](#clearsocketprofile) will be reported.

### getHttpEnableTimelineLogging

```
@Deprecated
HttpTimelineLoggingState getHttpEnableTimelineLogging(string isolateId)
```

The _getHttpEnableTimelineLogging_ RPC is used to remotely inspect the value of
`HttpClient.enableTimelineLogging`, which determines if HTTP client requests
should be logged to the timeline.

See [HttpTimelineLoggingState](#httptimelineloggingstate).

### setHttpEnableTimelineLogging

```
@Deprecated
Success setHttpEnableTimelineLogging(string isolateId, bool enable)
```

The _setHttpEnableTimelineLogging_ RPC is used to remotely set the value of
`HttpClient.enableTimelineLogging`, which determines if HTTP client requests
should be logged to the timeline. Note: this will only change the state of HTTP
timeline logging for the isolate specified by `isolateId`.

See [Success](#success).

### httpEnableTimelineLogging

```
HttpTimelineLoggingState httpEnableTimelineLogging(string isolateId, bool enabled [optional])
```

The _httpEnableTimelineLogging_ RPC is used to set and inspect the value of
`HttpClient.enableTimelineLogging`, which determines if HTTP client requests
should be logged to the timeline. If `enabled` is provided, the state of
`HttpClient.enableTimelineLogging` will be updated to the value of `enabled`.

If the value of `HttpClient.enableTimelineLogging` is changed, a
`HttpTimelineLoggingStateChange` event will be sent on the `Extension` stream.

See [HttpTimelineLoggingState](#httptimelineloggingstate).

### getHttpProfile

```
HttpProfile getHttpProfile(string isolateId, int updatedSince [optional])
```

The `getHttpProfile` RPC is used to retrieve HTTP profiling information
for requests made via `dart:io`'s `HttpClient`.

The returned `HttpProfile` will only include requests issued after
`httpTimelineLogging` has been enabled or after the last
`clearHttpProfile` invocation.

If `updatedSince` is provided, only requests started or updated since
the specified time will be reported.

See [HttpProfile](#httpprofile).

### getHttpProfileRequest

```
HttpProfileRequest getHttpProfileRequest(string isolateId, int id)
```

The `getHttpProfileRequest` RPC is used to retrieve an instance of `HttpProfileRequest`,
which includes request and response body data.

See [HttpProfileRequest](#httprofilerequest).

### clearHttpProfile

```
Success clearHttpProfile(string isolateId)
```

The `clearHttpProfile` RPC is used to clear previously recorded HTTP
requests from the HTTP profiler state. Requests still in-flight after
clearing the profiler state will be ignored by the profiler.

See [Success](#success).
