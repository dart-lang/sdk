// Defines a track for TrackEvents. Slices and instant events on the same track
// will be nested based on their timestamps, see TrackEvent::Type.

// A TrackDescriptor only needs to be emitted by one trace writer / producer and
// is valid for the entirety of the trace. To ensure the descriptor isn't lost
// when the ring buffer wraps, it should be reemitted whenever incremental state
// is cleared.
//
// As a fallback, TrackEvents emitted without an explicit track association will
// be associated with an implicit trace-global track (uuid = 0), see also
// |TrackEvent::track_uuid|. It is possible but not necessary to emit a
// TrackDescriptor for this implicit track.
//
// Next id: 9.

  // Producers should ensure that it is unlikely to clash with IDs emitted by
  // other producers. A value of 0 denotes the implicit trace-global track.

  // event id + id_scope, pid, and/or tid to compute this ID.

  // more (e.g. for asynchronous events), create child tracks using parent_uuid.
