"""Helper script for GN to run an arbitrary binary. See compiled_action.gni.

Run with:
  python gn_run_binary.py <invoker> <binary_name> [args ...]

Where <invoker> is either "compiled_action" or "exec_script". If it is
"compiled_action" the script has a non-zero exit code on a failure. If it is
"exec_script" the script has no output on success and produces output otherwise,
but always has an exit code of 0.
