# This script makes all JNI exported symbols local, to prevent the JVM from
# being able to find them, enforcing use of manual JNI function registration.
# This is used for all Android binaries by default, unless they explicitly state
# that they want JNI exported symbols to remain visible, as we need to ensure
# the manual registration path is correct to maintain compatibility with the
# crazy linker.
