Let's make a story. Add zero+ sentences for every commit:

CHÄPTER 1:
It was a dark and blinky night; the rain fell in torrents -- except at
occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which
swept up the streets (for it is in London that our scene lies), rattling along
the housetops, and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that
struggled against the elements. A hooded figure emerged.

It was a Domo-Kun.

"What took you so long?", inquired his wife.

Silence. Oblivious to his silence, she continued, "Did Mr. Usagi enjoy the
waffles you brought him?" "You know him, he's not one to forego a waffle,
no matter how burnt," he snickered.

The pause was filled with the sound of compile errors.

CHAPTER 2:
The jelly was as dark as night, and just as runny.
The Domo-Kun shuddered, remembering the way Mr. Usagi had speared his waffles
with his fork, watching the runny jelly spread and pool across his plate,
like the blood of a dying fawn. "It reminds me of that time --" he started, as
his wife cut in quickly: "-- please. I can't bear to hear it.". A flury of
images coming from the past flowed through his mind.

"You recall what happened on Mulholland drive?" The ceiling fan rotated slowly
overhead, barely disturbing the thick cigarette smoke. No doubt was left about
when the fan was last cleaned.

There was a poignant pause.

CHAPTER 3:
Mr. Usagi felt that something wasn't right. Shortly after the Domo-Kun left he
began feeling sick. He thought out loud to himself, "No, he wouldn't have done
that to me." He considered that perhaps he shouldn't have pushed so hard.
Perhaps he shouldn't have been so cold and sarcastic, after the unimaginable
horror that had occurred just the week before.

Next time, there won't be any sushi. Why sushi with waffles anyway?  It's like
adorning breakfast cereal with halibut -- shameful.

CHAPTER 4:
The taste of stale sushi in his mouth the next morning was unbearable. He
wondered where the sushi came from as he attempted to wash the taste away with
a bottle of 3000¥ sake. He tries to recall the cook's face.  Purple? Probably.

CHAPTER 5:
Many tears later, Mr. Usagi would laugh at the memory of the earnest,
well-intentioned Domo-Kun. Another day in the life. That is when he realized that
life goes on.

I'm really tempted to change something above the line.
Reeccciiiipppppeeeeeesssssss!!!!!!!!!
PEOPLE SAY "FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION", BUT FAILURE IS ALWAYS AN OPTION.
WHAT GOES UP MUST HAVE A NON-ZERO VELOCITY

I can feel the heat closing in, feel them out there making their moves...
What could possibly go wrong? We've already ate our cake.

Stand Still. Pause Clocks. We can make the World Stop.

I want a 1917 build and you will give me what I want.

This sentence is false.

Beauty is in the eyes of a Beholder.

I'm the best at space.

The first time Yossarian saw the chaplain, he fell madly in love with him.

Give not thyself up, then, to fire, lest it invert thee, deaden thee; as for
the time it did me. There is a wisdom that is woe; but there is a woe that is
madness. And there is a Catskill eagle in some souls that can alike dive down
into the blackest gorges, and soar out of them again and become invisible in
the sunny spaces. And even if he for ever flies within the gorge, that gorge
is in the mountains; so that even in his lowest swoop the mountain eagle is
still higher than other birds upon the plain, even though they soar.

This is a line to test and try uploading a cl.

And lo, in the year 2014, there was verily an attempt to upgrade to GCC 4.8 on
the Android bots, and it was good. Except on one bot, where it was bad. And
lo, the change was reverted, and GCC went back to 4.6, where code is slower
and less optimized. And verily did it break the build, because artifacts had
been created with 4.8, and alignment was no longer the same, and a great
sadness descended upon the Android GN buildbot, and it did refuseth to build
any more. But the sheriffs thought to themselves: Placebo! Let us clobber the
bot, and perhaps it will rebuild with GCC 4.6, which hath worked for many many
seasons. And so they modified the whitespace file with these immortal lines,
and visited it upon the bots, that great destruction might be wrought upon
their outdated binaries. In clobberus, veritas.

As the git approaches, light begins to shine through the SCM thrice again...
However, the git, is, after all, quite stupid.

Suddenly Domo-Kun found itself in a room filled with dazzling mirrors.

A herd of wild gits appears!  Time for CQ :D
And one more for sizes.py...

Sigh.

It was love at first sight.  The moment Yossarian first laid eyes on the chaplain, he fell madly in love with him.

Cool whitespace change for git-cl land

Oh god the bots are red! I'm blind! Mmmm, cronuts.

If you stand on your head, you will get footprints in your hair.

pick up cls

In the BUILD we trust.

In the masters we don't.
