# Set "Cache-Control" and "Expires" HTTP headers to only cache for one second.
# We do this because we frequently push new changes and rely on AppCache for
# caching.  Once files are installed in AppCache, the site launches
# immediately.
#
# Problem: PageSpeed Insights doesn't realize that we use AppCache and keeps
# nagging about caching.
# Solution: Ignore its advice about "Leverage browser caching".
